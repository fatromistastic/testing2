      <h1>Thoughts about art and my music</h1>
      <p>Every composer I know is <i>haunted</i> by the question ‘<i>What sort of music do you write?</i>’<br>
      Clicking the question below randomly retrieves a thought I’ve had about my music, or art in general, that I think is meaningful and shares something about my music and why I make art. Sometimes it will simply attempt to answer the question '<i>what is your music about?</i>' and '<i>why do you make it?</i>'</p>

    <p>This personal experiment is a kind of ‘meaning engine’ (and, I think, more fun than an artist’s statement or manifesto). I think of meaning as, simultaneously (and contradictorily), constructed and intrinsic to being in the world.<br><br>This ‘meaning engine’ generates its meaning by randomly selecting from disparate (but related) thoughts, thought over a long period of time, in a way that is both more comprehensive, and random, than my brain would be capable of doing on its own, on command, and less fortified and coherent than an artist’s statement probably should be.<br><br> Rather than dwelling on my failure (and perhaps disinclination) to have a good answer to a perfectly reasonable question, this collates and offers more (hopefully good, but realistically mixed quality) answers than anyone would ever need, want, or ever take on board and respond to - an overwhelming set of responses to an overwhelming question.<br><br>To me, asking ‘what sort of music do you write?’ is as abstract and baffling as asking someone who is a chef ‘what kind of flavour is your cooking’? Maybe they would have an answer, but if it’s <em>not</em> something like ‘Japanese cuisine’, something with a generally accepted or understood shared meaning, then one is stuck in the void. And if it's asked by someone who doesn't know anything about different kinds of cuisines, flavours, or ingredients, it's even harder.<br><br>I built this, to provide possible answers about why I do what I do and what I think is important about it, to me.
