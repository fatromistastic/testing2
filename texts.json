  "I’m rarely trying to impress and amaze with my music - I'm much more interesting in being able to intrigue and allure.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Ultimately, composition requires either a lot of self-belief or a lot of self-flagellation. Self-belief is better, but harder.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Finding numinous moments.\n\n(-Chris)",
 "“Captivating” and “evocative” are what I <em>want</em> my music to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "My music is a deliberate (self-conscious?) and direct expression of time\n\n(-Chris... a long time ago)",
  "Gloria Coates described her 4th Symphony as the “translation of a metaphysical experience into musical forms and content”. This is what I want all my music to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I want a music where a single dynamic can be heartbreaking, but I certainly need a music where a basic detail like a dynamic can make a difference to the piece, has musical meaning.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Can you still write music that is compellingly gorgeous? I certainly hope so, because I want to do that.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I want to write music that strikes a ‘balance between a state of hypnosis born of the repetition of a discreetly ornamented melody…, on the one hand, and the constant renewal of the harmony … on the other’, as the musicologist Isabelle Ragnard described medieval lyrical writing.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "In defence of abstraction, and its expressive purposes - \n\nFor me, abstraction is a relief, as release from the demands of the world.\n\nI recognise something that I think all people know, on some level, which is that it is not simply a case of my not knowing everything, but that there is much - including profoundly important things - that is unknowable. For me, that hazy realm beyond daily life is a constant part of my existence. Abstraction allows me to inhabit that hazy realm calmly, and cope with its reality - and so actual reality - much better. For me this is why ‘music as music’, can be more vital, more thrilling, more tantalising than just ‘music as story’. \n\n(-Chris)",
  "A child of globalisation, Chris music’ is international, and as boundary-less as it is barrier-less.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I think my music is fundamentally formalist [later edit: ‘except when it isn’t’]. I don’t much go in for 'conceptual' or 'critical', in part because I think music does form really well, and is always needing to be propped up by something else if it does conceptual or critical work. I’ve always come to music enamoured of its form (which, of course, includes - as it contains or is made of - material), and so I create from the same point of view.\n\n(-Chris)"
