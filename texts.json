  "I want to write music that strikes a ‘balance between a state of hypnosis born of the repetition of a discreetly ornamented melody… and the constant renewal of the harmony’, as musicologist Isabelle Ragnard once described medieval lyrical writing.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "In defence of abstraction, and its expressive purposes - \n\nFor me, abstraction is a relief, as a release from the demands of the world.\n\nI recognise something that I think all people know, on some level, which is that it is not simply a case of my not knowing everything, but that there is much - including profoundly important things - that is unknowable. For me, that hazy realm beyond daily life is a constant part of my existence. Abstraction allows me to inhabit that hazy realm calmly, and cope with its reality - and so actual reality - much better. For me this is why ‘music as music’, can be more vital, more thrilling, more tantalising than just ‘music as story’. \n\n(-Chris)",
  "A child of globalisation, Chris's music is international, and as boundary-less as it is barrier-less.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I think my music is fundamentally formalist [later edit: ‘except when it isn’t’]. I don’t much go in for 'conceptual' or 'critical', in part because I think music does form really well, but always needs to be propped up by something else if it does conceptual or critical work. I’ve always come to music enamoured of its form (which, of course, includes - as it contains or is made of - material), and so I create from the same point of view.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am sceptical of any simple, singular description of music, and as such feel the dishonesties of offering such a simple description of my music acutely. A simple, singular explanation is necessarily ordered, logical, complete, and narrativised in a way that always strikes me as distorting reality, and untenably so. I hope these collected skerricks of thoughts and speculations offer insight and at least begin to answer, if not over-answer, the question of my music through the collected weight of their partial and fragmentary force.\n\n(-Chris)",

"My music is driven by harmonic and timbral narratives.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In any approach to music, I think it repays to remain radically open-minded - to entertain that music might carry no meaning itself, and also that it might covertly contain every possible cultural meaning, or formal construction imaginable. Unless we remain critical to every approach, how can we be critical of any approach? What is 'proof' in music?\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s all well and good to say ‘I want the piece to do X’ - something you can easily do - but really a piece dictates its own terms if you’re listening carefully, and I think the most important job you have to do is not say ‘I want the piece to do X’, but to make sure you are listening carefully and helping the piece to be how the piece wants to be.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Music that is a meditation upon a moment in time, a drawing of attention to a detail in and of an eternal present. This is particularly important for an anxious person - there is relief in, but also something tantalising about, the present and ‘presentness’. I don’t naturally dwell there, but - perhaps in part because of this - I love it there.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think my music is captured by an observation I had in response to the music of the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara: 'an important feature of Rautavaara and of mystics more generally is this sense of eternity in perpetual motion - heard or unheard, as if we are dipping into an eternity - an eternity music - that is already there before music begins and continues after music has finished.\n\nWhat is important is not happening at the local level, <em>and</em> being boring can be a longer term strategy. Eternity is boring but it is also sublime (in the true Kantian sense - terrifying if terrifyingly beautiful).\n\nThink of a trance that is, at once, boring and ecstatic.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Instead of a description, a possible diagnosis of my paralysis at the question 'what sort of music do you write?': I do want people to like me, a condition that extends to my music. I don’t want people to be put off from listening by what I say (which ignores the fact that invariably equivocating as I do does put people off, anyway...). The paralysis is that if I give the 'wrong' answer, then something is closed off (or I am hemmed in), whether or not that’s a fair and accruate reflection of reality.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If I could write a music that is simply sacred, secret, and beautiful, I’d be completely content.\n\n(-Chris)",  
"For this one, I defer to the Icelandic composer Anna Þorvaldsdóttir: 'As with my music generally, the inspiration… is not something I am trying to describe through the piece - to me, the qualities of the music are first and foremost musical. When I am inspired by a particular element or quality, it is because I perceive it as musically interesting, and the qualities I tend to be inspired by are often structural, like proportion and flow, as well as relationships of balance between details within a larger structure, and how to move in perspective between the two — the details and the unity of the whole.'\n\nThis so perfectly captures so many of my own feelings, that I don't know what else to add, beyond pointing out that there is *also* something deeply spiritual about the final, practical, obersvation about the balance between the details and 'unity of the whole'.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Margaret Heffernan, in discussing artists who - like the author Murakami - don't plan their works in advance, speaks of the 'tension between curiosity and discipline'. This pairing speaks directly to how I feel about my work. Heffernan goes on to speak of artists needing to be 'robust enough to keep working at something they don’t understand yet'.\n\nAll artist need stamina, stamina to keep going in the face of sometimes complete uncertainty and ambiguity.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Context is key in the life of any piece. So much so-called ‘classical’ music written today seems to pay attention to its context as background music. It gives life to certain kinds of music, even as it makes music that feel disappointing in other contexts (like a concert, for example) when one is actually actively listening to it <em>as</em> music, not ignoring it as background.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Philosopher Jerrold Levinson, struggling to generally define music’s ontology beyond the famous ‘organised time’ dictum, notes ‘music… is engaged in so that a certain <em> heightening</em> of life, or of consciousness, is attained’, going on to say ‘music seems aimed at the <em>enrichment or intensification of experience</em> via engagement with organised sounds as such.’\n\n(-Chris)",

"My music is an existential bellow.\n\n(-Chris)",

"I work from the music, out. I listen to the sounds and try to discern where they need to go and what they want to say once they’ve found their way. I rarely start with a preconceived idea, or any sense that I know more than the music, or indeed more than music - I don't.\n\n(-Chris)",

I love the term, and the description. I could get on board with ‘liminalism’ as a description of a musical style, though it’s really more of a musical mindset, and one that I share.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is utterly the product, and so completely a reflection, of my chronically restless, and occasionally relentless, mind.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Musical poetics.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Rather than being drawn to what I already understand, I have always been - to a fault - much more attracted by things that I don’t understand. And if no one else understands them, even better. This, for me, is where the most interesting notions - spirituality, fractals, neural networks - lie, and it’s also what makes life meaningful. Music is one of these things, and knowing exactly what is going on in it is an anathema to me while the struggle with that unknowing-ness, the struggle to understand it, and the pleasure of failing, is part of what I adore about the subject. Esotericism and Mysticism abound in this worldview.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"Maria Popova <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/about/\">describes her work on <em>The Marginalian</em> </a> as 'a record of my reading and reckoning with our search for meaning'.\n\nI would describe my music as almost exactly the same - a record of my reckoning with our search for meaning - meaning felt, not thought, expressed, not spoken.\n\nPopova, to my delight, goes further: 'our search for meaning: sometimes through science and philosophy, sometimes through poetry… always through the lens of wonder.' That is my music, precisely.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My Music is both my reflection on and my reflection of the beauty in the world around me.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I think, often of the genre and translation of Zuihitsu ('follow the brush'). I think if I invented a musical genre for my work it would be Zuihitsu - follow the brush.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If narrative is ‘an organised sequence of events with a beginning, a middle, and an end' then I wonder about what a koan is, and a musical koan. Is that what I want to write? Sometimes? I think maybe that’s what I would call my musical ‘threads’. Do I string them together into sequences? Can I? Do I want to? I'm not sure.\n\n(-Chris)",  
"'The speculative, in fiction or poetry, deals with a world that is different from the one we experience in at least one way. It may be the same world in the future, or a different world.' - From ‘Stars Like Sand: Australian Speculative Poetry' by by Tim Jones , and P. S. Cottier.\n\nDo I write speculative music?\n\n(-Chris)",
"I have always felt, even when unable to articulate or be entirely conscious of it, that there is 'something more' in the world, in our experience, something that is 'beyond'. Music is the most tangible thing I know that directly engages with this beyond, and so music for me is what other spiritual practice - religion, capitalism, etc. - is for others. It fills that spiritual dimension that we are, these days, embarrassed to discuss because it doesn’t have an obvious place in the scientific, 'rational', post-enlightenment cultural west.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write 'just the kind of sound I had long looked for - a mysterious, complex sound with an intangible, enigmatic harmony which I found intensely beautiful', to appropriate the words of the British composer Reginald Smith Brindle (having just heard ‘The Prisoner’ by Dallapiccola).\n\n(-Chris)",
"This is a tractate on my music, but not tractate in the usual usage.\n\nIn his 'A Tractate on Japanese Aesthetics', Donald Richie notes 'Among other ideas, Eastern aesthetics suggests that ordered structure contrives, that logical exposition falsifies, and that linear, consecutive argument eventually limits.' He He then presents <em>his</em> tractate in the as being in the spirit of the <em>Zuihitsu</em> - a word translated from the Japanese as ‘essay’ but nonetheless completely different from the western meaning of the word ‘essay’, with differing shades of meaning and histories.\n\nIn particular, Richie mentions the Japanese use of ‘juxtaposition, for assembling, for bricolage… Many Japanese writers prize a quality of indecision in the structure of their work. And something too logical, too symmetrical is successfully avoided when writers ignore suppositions of the questions asked of them. It is then not the assumptions of the writer’s controlling mind that are followed by, as the Japanese phrase it, the brush itself’ before evoking Zuihitsu again - ‘following the brush, allowing it to lead. The structure is the multiplicity of strokes that make up the aesthetic quality, one which they imply and which we infer.’\n\n(-Chris)",
"My gift from my mentor Nigel Butterley - my musical inheritance - is less about style per se (although we certainly share some values about harmony and musical affect), but more about mindset and outlook, both on art and the mystical more generally.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I’m often asked what my music is ‘about’. You know those unutterable, guttural, thoughts - the visceral ones without words - that well up inside of you, but have no expression or articulation? The ones that wake you in the night in fear, in wonder, in awe, with love, fear, and every possible configuration and reconfiguration of the universe beyond your mortal mind and self, but also enveloping them and enveloped by them?\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s poetic music. If you accept that poetry can get at things that prose cannot - and I do accept that it does, not always directly, not always rationally, but it does it just the same - then I think about my music in the same way. It is about accessing things that are beyond the mundane, that are lost in more prosaic forms. Brain and heart, body and soul, all the way down. \n\nAnd, as Borges had it - 'life is, I am sure, made of poetry'.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think about my music the same way Maria Popova thinks about poetry - 'under its slow seduction, I came to see how it shines a sidewise gleam on the invisible and unnameable regions of being where the truest truths dwell, the most difficult and the most beautiful; how it sneaks in through the backdoor of consciousness to reveal us more fully to ourselves; how it gives us an instrument for paying attention, which is how we learn to love the world more… a way of finding the intimate in the universal and the universal in the intimate.'\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think I am, at least in part, a neo-transcendentalist, inasmuch as I believe in the unity of science, spirituality, love, and art in the construction of a meaningful life.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Messiaen, arguing <em>against</em> a description of himself as a mystical musician (which, in any case, he is), stated that ‘I am not a mystical musician, but a Surrealist musician who exceeds his desire for the Surreal by the supernatural’. It's a marvellous denial that confirms what it's denying, while also deepening and enriching it. I have a profound symapthy for the idea of a Surrealist who exceeds his desire for the Surreal by the supernatural.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In my homeland, there’s a bird called a lyrebird that collects beautiful things and arranges them as a nesting place. I’m a lyrebird.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The aim of my music is to add poetry to the world in the language I find most potent.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that takes you out of yourself.",
"If language delineates identity, and in delineating both fortifies and creates it, music has the potential to free us of this, just as it has the potential to similarly fortify and create.\n\nPut simply, I think music is the most powerful and magic substance in the universe. It does many things, it can do many things, and it is irreducible.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The people who write music like music I write are no good at simple answers, so it may be no coincidence that we lack a good description of the music we write.\n\n(-Chris)",
"An attempt to reserve an autonomous status for art can’t *just* be insidious/malignant. Of course it is if it's in the pursuit of erasure (or even if it does this incidentally), but that - or fear of that - can’t preclude contemplative purity as a pursuit, can it?\n\nI think it was transgressive, when I was being musically educated at a tertiary level, to say I liked a piece - a piece was either good (worthy), or not. I think this was a toxic result of the Idea of Art linked to the negative side of Art for Art’s sake (the autonomous status for art), but declaring a subject with desires - the ‘I’ who likes and dislikes a piece - has to also allow for a healthy space for <em>musical contemplation</em>, freed - if desired or desirable - from other ‘un-artly’ concerns, it just can’t - and shouldn’t - preclude other conditions of musical being in its wake and it has to accept the conditions of such a state, that it might just as easily be rejoiced in as rejected for its claims to autonomy.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There’s a whole lot of noise out there (not literal noise - but there’s a lot of that too), and ultimately you have to live (live with yourself) so you have to create what lets you live (with yourself). Ultimately, I think your art is about being honest (with yourself, and the world), and holding on to the things you genuinely love, while not worrying about the incessant noise. That’s all distraction.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Perhaps I want to imitate the best part of the best <em>artificial</em> intelligence in my work, or at least way of working - combining impossibly and inexplicably disparate cultural objects into a new whole.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is about finding connections and connection.\n\nJust as I contain multitudes, I have lived many lives and my music is therefore not singular but struggling towards that absence.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There’s a large mound of earth on the Orkney islands. We have no written record from the people who built it - how they built it, or why - but we know it took a lot of serious and hard work to construct, and that it’s a magic place, deliberately built to capture and deify light with the passing of time. It’s inexplicable, but despite this deeply moving and meaningful. This, for me, is the very best music and the kind of music I always try to write. It’s hard work, it’s inexplicable, but it is driven by an unknown sense of purpose and necessity with a view to adding to the wonder of the earth, by drawing from its immeasurable well.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/09/aaron-copland-creative-experience/\">speaking about American composer Aaron Copland, says</a> \"More than the mere exorcism of emotion, Copland argues that the magic of music lies in its ability to translate our concrete thoughts and feelings into an enchanting abstract experience\".\n\nLater on, quoting Copland directly, she notes how \"everyone is supposed to like music, but people who are really musically gifted don’t seem to have the need for having music’s significance made specific. They can think about music and enthuse about it, and that’s all that’s necessary… One of the reasons why cultivated music is one of the glories of mankind… is that we are dealing in amorphous, highly abstract material without any specific thought content.\"\n\nElsewhere, Copland says \"The arts in general, I think, help to give significance to life. That’s one of their very basic and important functions.\"\n\nSo what do I want my music to be? ‘An enchanting abstract experience, free from specific significance but not free from significance - an amorphous, highly abstract material without any specific thought content, giving significance to life…'\n\n(-Chris)",

"Burke said, of politicians - ‘Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays you instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.’ It’s not an opinion, I think, that would be widely well-received today, and I hate to compare my work to a politician's work, but I think the same holds true of an artist - I owe you my industry and judgement, even if - unfortunately - you don’t like the results, and to do otherwise is to betray you instead of serving you.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/10/10/a-private-history-of-happiness/\">speaking about Petrarch, sums up my own feelings about composer:</a>\n\n\"In a letter to his friend, abbot Peter of St. Benigno in Italy, poet and scholar Francesco Petrarca celebrates the relentless rewards of writing:\n\n<em>Strangely enough I long to write, but do not know what or to whom. This inexorable passion has such a hold upon me that pen, ink, and paper, and work prolonged far into the night, are more to my liking than repose and sleep. In short, I find myself always in a sad and languishing state when I am not writing, and, anomalous though it seems, I labour when I rest, and find my rest in labour. My mind is hard as rock, and you might well think that it really sprang from one of Deucalion’s stones.\n\nLet this tireless spirit pore eagerly over the parchment, until it has exhausted both fingers and eyes by the long strain, yet it feels neither heat nor cold, but would seem to be reclining upon the softest down. It is only fearful that it may be dragged away, and holds fast the mutinous members. Only when sheer necessity has compelled it to quit does it begin to flag. It takes a recess as a lazy ass takes his pack when he is ordered up a sharp hill, and comes back again to its task as a tired ass to his well-filled manger. My mind finds itself refreshed by prolonged exercise, as the beast of burden by his food and rest. What then am I to do, since I cannot stop writing, or bear even the thought of rest? I write to you, not because what I have to say touches you nearly, but because there is no one so accessible just now who is at the same time so eager for news, especially about me, and so intelligently interested in strange and mysterious phenomena, and ready to investigate them.\"</em>\n\n(-Chris)",
"A family friend, a catholic priest (and a very good musician), once asked me - knowing I had no conventional religious affinity - what I made of the ‘big stuff’ (life, death, etc.). It was an honest inquiry, without expectation, just honest curiosity. I answered that music is basically my answer to the big stuff, and it seemed a plausible answer for someone steeped in both formal religion and music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My current work is - really, at base - nothing more and nothing less than judging timings. How long should an idea go on, how should it balance against the duration of a different idea. How do they collide? What’s the energy across the longer timespan of a piece? These are the questions that obsess me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am interested in intricate and interwoven layers of meaning from the personal to the universal, allusions that point in many directions at once, rich with meaning and potential meaning.\n\nMy first string quartet, <em>The true ceremony of the sun</em>, that I'm working on now generates meaning on multiple levels for me - personal, interpersonal, formal, narrative, intimate and universal. This is what interests me about it - and about music more generally.\n\n(-Chris)",
"At base, I will never get over - can never get over - what music is capable of doing to someone, it’s an incredibly powerful, intangible thing.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I can never really get over the fact that simple musical motion can express - be expressive - and become 'emergently' complex - this is music at its best.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In the American painter Rockwell Kent I am reminded of what I admire most - an aching, almost bodily - belief in Art as a high and exulting human ideal. It is so unfashionable to say, much less believe, that these days, and yet when I see it expressed, believed - lived in the case of Kent - I have such existential relief that I am not alone in this unshakeable belief.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There remains something - perhaps perversely - appealing to me about taking the simplest possible idea, making it more simple, then stretching it as far as is reasonable and then taking it further…\n\n(-Chris)",
"I want my music to hold you in a world that is removed from the mundane (a thought thought while listening to a piece by someone I admire that fails to do this...).\n\n(-Chris)",
"I refer you to Umberto Eco. In his <em>Six walks in the fictional woods</em> he notes: 'Labrunie ironically says (in a letter to Alexandre Dumas which appears in <em>Les Filles du feu</em>) that his works are no more complicated than Hegel’s metaphysics, adding that ‘they would lose their charm if they were explained, if that were possible.’\n\nIt’s a fabulous point of view in and of itself, but I love it even more for how it seems to echo the French composer, Olivier Messiaen, speaking of the ‘charm of impossibilities’ in his work.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Studying 'awe' across 26 cultures, Dacher Keltner found that music emerged <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/01/06/dacher-keltner-awe-music/\">'as the most universal of our creaturely portals into transcendence':</a>\n\n 'Music breaks down the boundaries between self and other and can unite us in feelings of awe…When we listen to music with others, the great rhythms of our bodies — heartbeat, breathing, hormonal fluctuations, sexual cycles, bodily motion — once separate, merge into a synchronized pattern. We sense that we are part of something larger, a community, a pattern of energy, an idea of the times — or what we might call the sacred.'\n\n(-Chris)",
"I know I'm supposed to shun the idea of Great Art in this day and age, but I love this incisive view from Iris Murdoch - 'great Art teaches us how real things can be looked at and loved without being seized and used'.\n\nThe quote goes on to talk about this Art as almost cultivated - a 'learned' art of detachment (a detachment that is both 'difficult and valuable' to which I'd add 'necessary'). I think this is the art that interests me, that is important to me - a learned skill that denies its own obvious artificiality. A paradox.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that requires Love and Attention.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think I grew up in a very proscriptive environment (tyrannical modernists fighting tyrannical post - or pre - modernists), and that finding permission for and an art that simply, interetingly, and unproblematically permits beautiful things has been my biggest aim and challenge as a result.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I believe in good proportions, but also in absolutes. Musical ideas, generally, last between 45 seconds to 2 minutes… there are (excellent) extremes in either direction, but there’s a sweet spot between about 45 seconds to 2 minutes that, I think, captures a lot of music, even much <strong>longer</strong> music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s music that I think other people can find difficult and confusing, and while lots of what I love - really love - in this world is difficult and confusing, it seems counterintuitive to describe something I love above all else, music, in terms that are usually pejorative. But more than that, I don’t find it difficult. And, in any case, my confusion about it is different to theirs.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write poetic music. You know how poems don’t always give you straightforward answers but they seem to respond big and urgent questions? That’s the kind of music I write.\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s music about my complete non-comprehension of the world, and its beauty, strangeness and terror.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am reminded, by the quote below, of how profoundly interested I am in the 'proliferation of meaning and reference':\n\n'In keeping with the proliferation of references and signifying tendrils of Ueno’s art, several layers of meaning are embedded in the title <em>Future Lilacs</em>'\n\nIt's also an excellent title. I wish I'd come up with that one.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The Australian Composer Mary Finsterer said 'we are all reminded every day of our mortality, but that’s not a reason to shy away from it. I hope I will embrace every opportunity to keep learning, and that’s what every day grants me.'\n\nMy music is about not knowing the answers but loving the questions, and questioning, especially when reminded of our own mortality, as we are every day.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I composed a piece right at the end of my undergraduate years called 'that a circle, this a line'. It was a text that I collaged together and really loved. It was about how we are at once finite - a human life extends as a line - and infinite - part of nature, community, humanity, a circle - and that within our experience of the world there are these circles, and these lines. I don’t think I understood then (or even now) exactly how profound this simple idea is, but I really think it accounts for so much that is meaningful to me - the interaction of circles and lines, the beauty of the finite colliding with the infinite, the periodic with the directed - that’s everything for me. Everything was there back then in this simple literary metaphor that I liked but couldn't fully grasp and probably never will.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that exalts, and so expands, our little lives in the universe.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music details my restless and ceaseless curiosity about, and search for, beauty and meaning in the world.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is always about death, in the sense that it is always about ‘the otherworldly’ and seeks to evoke - in some way - the magic, the spiritual, the irrational, emotional depths of that abyss. Whatever that otherworldly thing is, and sometimes the easiest ‘worldly’ view of it is just what is after death (and so, definitionally, outside being and time), it is the infinite. My music is always seeking the infinite and so unattainable.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There is a cost to living in this world. I have more pieces I want to write than time in my lifetime, and because I do have to live in this world - love, sleep, eat, exercise - I am drawn away from ideas I would otherwise pursue ceaselessly. You are so much defined by - through chance, and determination - the ideas that you can wrench away from the real world and finish.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Belief is the single most important thing you can have. You have to believe - really believe - in what you’re doing, It doesn’t matter what the ‘it’ is, you have to believe. I believe in music. I believe in composition.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From the moment Hermes’ lyre sang Orpheus’s song, music became - definitionally - hermetic. It is a hermetic art.\n\n(-Chris)",
"No matter how you construe or misconstrue it, there’s something mystical about music - if there weren’t there wouldn’t be so many different attempts to explore and explain it from so many different points of view. There is no ‘right’ view, but the pursuit of singular views reveals the multiplicity of views that is singular and definitional.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I find it difficult to coherently discuss my music because of two apparently contradictory things about it: It is, of course, a personal expression, but it is also *always* seeking - aspiring - to an impersonal state.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I can find no better explanation than Leibniz's famous definition of music as the ‘occult numeration of the soul’. This is my exact trinity - music is occult, numerical, and spirit.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"My music is my attempt to escape (transcend?) the tyranny of simple materialism.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"The importance, the function, of Art for me - and so music, specifically - is to add magic and wonder to the world.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I have always felt profound sympathy with the cross-cultural ontological view that there is always, eternally, music playing - unheard - and that if we are lucky, as listeners, composers, human beings, we will be able to briefly dip into different layers of that eternal music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"A simple answer (for once, and in contrast to this whole site and process): I hope it’s strange and evocative music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Speculative and Liminal Music is what I keep coming back to. My music is speculative and liminal - with all the possible meanings and ambiguities latent in that description.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I don't want to use a chromatic cluster unless I can have a C major chord too, and vice versa.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is my 'unselfing' - it is about leaving myself and loving the universe.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There is something pretentious in any artist claiming that they have insight above or beyond anyone else, but I have come to realise I have a very unusual curiosity that is distinct and particular, and that my art is every bit a product of that curiosity as it is the cause. It is not insight, but it is a relentlessly driving force.\n\n(-Chris)",
"It would be wrong and dismissive to suggest that music’s purpose is just to thwart extreme materialists, but it’s also not an uninformative provocation upon which to reflect.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Joscelyn Godwin has noted the Alsation musicologist Marius Schneider’s observation that \"in the cultures where music is still used as a magical force, the making of an instrument always involves the sacrifice of a living being. That being’s soul then becomes part of the instrument, and in the tones that come forth from it the ‘singing dead’ who are ever present with us make themselves heard.\" \n\nI can’t think of a more lovely or apt notion, nor a more insightful thought about music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Musicologist Joscelyn Godwin asserts that ‘there are certain needs which music best fulfils, but it may be music of many types’, making the first division ‘according to the three regions of the human being: belly, chest, and head. Every developed culture has music aimed at each level. There is visceral music…Next there is heart and its emotions…Thirdly there is music which sets thoughts in motion’.\n\nIt’s an astute observation that is completely obvious once stated. It also goes some way towards understanding the conflict between musical styles and the sometimes mutual non-comprehension of one musical community to another. If you want belly music, and get head music, it’s - at best - confusing.\n\nI want to write music that reserves the ability to be belly, chest, and/or head music, but I also think that aim is unusual. I think - without thinking - most music just falls into one category, even if aspiring to others. I think there is something interesting about being able to deploy all three, if and when needed.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If in daily life, ego is in control with id assisting, my music is about trying to let id take over, with ego just assisting - after the fact.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From the marvellous Christopher Alexander in his book, A Pattern Language: ‘No people who turn their backs on death can be alive. The presence of the dead among the living will be a daily fact in any society which encourages its people to live.’\n\n‘The presence of the dead’ is an important idea for me. We are always in the presence of the dead, but nowhere more so than in music, for me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Steven Watson, <a href=\"https://interlude.hk/frederic-mompou-and-his-musica-callada/\">speaking of Frederic Mompou</a> says his ‘music exists in the liminal space between ancient and modern. Nowhere is this more true than his <em>Musica Callada</em> (which roughly translates as ‘Music of Silence’). In many ways, it is his most radically modern work, yet its extreme spareness and slowness suggest ritual and ancient mystery.’\n\nThis description has much of what I want in my music – ancient, modern, ritual, spareness, mystery, liminal spaces.\n\n(-Chris)",
"A very 'earthy kind of music', which is a line that comes from me misreading commentary about other music that did not say this. I want to write a very earthy kind of music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"After the premiere of Debussy's string quartet, Guy Ropartz described the quartet as 'dominated by the influence of young Russia; there are poetic themes, rare sonorities'.\n\nPoetic themes and rare sonorities are key to my own music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Taruskin’s view of Scriabin is that his whole stylistic evolution can be viewed as the gradual extinguishing of the desiring subject, the \"petty ‘I’\".\n\nThis is how I want to write music - that same extinguishing.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From John Ashbery’s <em>Three Poems </em> - \n\n'The magic world really does exist. Its dumbness is the proof of this. Indeed any sign of activity on its part would be cause for alarm, since it does not need us, need to signal its clarion certainties into our abashed, timid, half‐make‐believe commerce of every day.'\n\nArt is in that magic world, or at least it's the closest we can get on this side of life.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is like the art that I love - it disrupts but need not disturb. By waking people up, rather than lulling them with what they know, you open the possibility of insight not afforded someone who is simply satiating an expectation, fulfilling themselves without a disruption. The disruption is important. It’s key to any enlightenment.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"My music is simply a response to all the beauty in the world - the overwhelming-ness of its all-ness.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is my engagement with the ancient, the modern, and the intermundane.\n\n(-Chris)"
