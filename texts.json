  "I’m rarely trying to impress and amaze with my music - I'm much more interesting in being able to intrigue and allure.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Ultimately, composition requires either a lot of self-belief or a lot of self-flagellation. Self-belief is better, but harder.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Finding numinous moments.\n\n(-Chris)",
 "“Captivating” and “evocative” are what I <em>want</em> my music to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "My music is a deliberate (self-conscious?) and direct expression of time.\n\n(-Chris... a long time ago)",
  "Gloria Coates described her 4th Symphony as the “translation of a metaphysical experience into musical forms and content”. This is what I want all my music to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I want a music where a single dynamic can be heartbreaking, and I need a music where a basic detail like a dynamic can make a difference to a piece, have musical meaning.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Can you still write music that is compellingly gorgeous? I certainly hope so, because I want to do that.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I want to write music that strikes a ‘balance between a state of hypnosis born of the repetition of a discreetly ornamented melody… and the constant renewal of the harmony’, as musicologist Isabelle Ragnard once described medieval lyrical writing.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "In defence of abstraction, and its expressive purposes - \n\nFor me, abstraction is a relief, as a release from the demands of the world.\n\nI recognise something that I think all people know, on some level, which is that it is not simply a case of my not knowing everything, but that there is much - including profoundly important things - that is unknowable. For me, that hazy realm beyond daily life is a constant part of my existence. Abstraction allows me to inhabit that hazy realm calmly, and cope with its reality - and so actual reality - much better. For me this is why ‘music as music’, can be more vital, more thrilling, more tantalising than just ‘music as story’. \n\n(-Chris)",
  "A child of globalisation, Chris's music is international, and as boundary-less as it is barrier-less.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I think my music is fundamentally formalist [later edit: ‘except when it isn’t’]. I don’t much go in for 'conceptual' or 'critical', in part because I think music does form really well, but always needs to be propped up by something else if it does conceptual or critical work. I’ve always come to music enamoured of its form (which, of course, includes - as it contains or is made of - material), and so I create from the same point of view.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am sceptical of any simple, singular description of music, and as such feel the dishonesties of offering such a simple description of my music acutely. A simple, singular explanation is necessarily ordered, logical, complete, and narrativised in a way that always strikes me as distorting reality, and untenably so. I hope these collected skerricks of thoughts and speculations offer insight and at least begin to answer, if not over-answer, the question of my music through the collected weight of their partial and fragmentary force.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I contain multitudes\n\n(-Chris...quoting)",
"Australian composer Matthew Shlomowitz theorises the 'capricious composer' in his article <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/its-not-about-you-do-we-still-need-an-artistic-voice/F38962E33164405DA089724DBFA8D22F\">\"IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU: DO WE STILL NEED AN 'ARTISTIC VOICE'?\"</a>, but I prefer to adopt and adapt the term 'curious composer' (not only for the inherent ambiguity) from his observation in the same article: 'a curious composer who explores different idioms is surely in step with the pluralist and decentred nature of the contemporary world.'\n\nI am a curious composer.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that is beyond the veil, rather than beyond the pale.\n\n(-Chris)",
"William Butler Yeats said that \"in Ireland this world and the world we go to after death are not far apart.\"\n\nI want music that is in that closeness and so - somehow - beyond this world, between the worlds.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think about what I do as musical poetry - there is absolutely musical prose, and it's different from what I do. I also remember W.B.Yeats in that same moment. Yeats said \"What can be explained is not poetry.\"\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s not pastiche and it’s not ironic. If it’s naive - so be it. It’s sincere and that’s all I care about. I *mean* it.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is driven by harmonic and timbral narratives.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In any approach to music, I think it repays to remain radically open-minded - to entertain that music might carry no meaning itself, and also that it might covertly contain every possible cultural meaning, or formal construction imaginable. Unless we remain critical to every approach, how can we be critical of any approach? What is 'proof' in music?\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s all well and good to say ‘I want the piece to do X’ - something you can easily do - but really a piece dictates its own terms if you’re listening carefully, and I think the most important job you have to do is not say ‘I want the piece to do X’, but to make sure you are listening carefully and helping the piece to be how the piece wants to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I seek to find little bits of beauty in the world - cracks of unexpected light that contrast with the grey - and hold on to them, desperately, for as long as I possibly can.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that is magic, that is numinous - a numinous ground.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Expressive modernism - an apparent contradiction in terms. Modernism, in its true (so 'pure') form, should not express anything, right?\n\n(-Chris)",
"I try to compose glimpses of other worlds. For me it’s important that my music sits outside of everyday experience.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that is a meditation upon a moment in time, a drawing of attention to a detail in and of an eternal present. This is particularly important for an anxious person - there is relief in, but also something tantalising about, the present and ‘presentness’. I don’t naturally dwell there, but - perhaps in part because of this - I love it there.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think my music is captured by an observation I had in response to the music of the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara: 'an important feature of Rautavaara and of mystics more generally is this sense of eternity in perpetual motion - heard or unheard, as if we are dipping into an eternity - an eternity music - that is already there before music begins and continues after music has finished.\n\nWhat is important is not happening at the local level, <em>and</em> being boring can be a longer term strategy. Eternity is boring but it is also sublime (in the true Kantian sense - terrifying if terrifyingly beautiful).\n\nThink of a trance that is, at once, boring and ecstatic.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Instead of a description, a possible diagnosis of my paralysis at the question 'what sort of music do you write?': I do want people to like me, a condition that extends to my music. I don’t want people to be put off from listening by what I say (which ignores the fact that invariably equivocating as I do does put people off, anyway...). The paralysis is that if I give the 'wrong' answer, then something is closed off (or I am hemmed in), whether or not that’s a fair and accruate reflection of reality.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If I could write a music that is simply sacred, secret, and beautiful, I’d be completely content.\n\n(-Chris)",  
"For this one, I defer to the Icelandic composer Anna Þorvaldsdóttir: 'As with my music generally, the inspiration… is not something I am trying to describe through the piece - to me, the qualities of the music are first and foremost musical. When I am inspired by a particular element or quality, it is because I perceive it as musically interesting, and the qualities I tend to be inspired by are often structural, like proportion and flow, as well as relationships of balance between details within a larger structure, and how to move in perspective between the two — the details and the unity of the whole.'\n\nThis so perfectly captures so many of my own feelings, that I don't know what else to add, beyond pointing out that there is *also* something deeply spiritual about the final, practical, obersvation about the balance between the details and 'unity of the whole'.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is about co-existence, in so many meanings and applications of the word.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I keep coming back to magic. I think I respond to anything that creates magic, and magic isn’t genre-specific.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Margaret Heffernan, in discussing artists who - like the author Murakami - don't plan their works in advance, speaks of the 'tension between curiosity and discipline'. This pairing speaks directly how I feel about my work. Heffernan goes on to speak of artists needing to be 'robust enough to keep working at something they don’t understand yet'\n\nAll artist need stamina, stamina to keep going in the face of sometimes complete uncertainty and ambiguity.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Context is key in the life of any piece. So much so-called ‘classical’ music written today seems to pay attention to its context as background music. It gives life to certain kinds of music, even as it makes music that feel disappointing in other contexts (like a concert, for example) when one is actually actively listening to it <em>as</em> music, not ignoring it as background.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My default assumption about my audience (and so when composing) is that they will be concentrating, they will be listening to the details and for the shape of details of details.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"Philosopher Jerrold Levinson, struggling to generally define music’s ontology beyond the famous ‘organised time’ dictum, notes ‘music… is engaged in so that a certain <em> heightening</em> of life, or of consciousness, is attained’, going on to say ‘music seems aimed at the <em>enrichment or intensification of experience</em> via engagement with organised sounds as such.’\n\n(-Chris)",
"Art should be humbling. It should, rightly, remind us of how little we know.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is an existential bellow.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The most profound, and profoundly meaningful, experiences and feelings in my life are not clearly articulable - they are a blend of rich ambiguity, of disorder and richness, thrill, and satisfaction. Music is the only thing that speaks in the same way as these experiences.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I'd like to think of myself as a post-style composer, not because I am - it's a self-defeating term - but because that would be a nice thing to consider onself.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Art invites us, in fact what I call art requires us, to be outside of ourselves, to reflect back on our own humanity, and identity.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I work from the music, out. I listen to the sounds and try to discern where they need to go and what they want to say once they’ve found their way. I rarely start with a preconceived idea, or any sense that I know more than the music, or indeed more than music - I don't.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I worry about composers justifying their music just to other composers. We risk creating a hermetically sealed space, and developing strategies and habits that are incoherent beyond that hermetically sealed space.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The British musician and thinker Milton Mermikides <a href=\"https://www.miltonline.com/2017/01/10/on-liminalism\"> describes his term ‘liminalism’</a> in saying: ‘I am more interested in the common themes, processes and craft between …styles and the creation of musical works born of an open sharing…I quietly call this pursuit of universal musical craft <em>liminalism</em>’. I love the term, and the description. I could get on board with ‘liminalism’ as a description of a musical style, though it’s really more of a musical mindset, and one that I share.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is utterly the product, and so completely a reflection, of my chronically restless, and occasionally relentless, mind.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music is always an excavation of the past - personal and interpersonal (i.e. cultural). How could it be otherwise? Even the drive for innovation, the drive to break with the past, is itself a repeating part of the past.\n\n(-Chris)",
"A music that is not part of everyday experience.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Musical poetics.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Rather than being drawn to what I already understand, I have always been - to a fault - much more attracted by things that I don’t understand. And if no one else understands them, even better. This, for me, is where the most interesting notions - spirituality, fractals, neural networks - lie, and it’s also what makes life meaningful. Music is one of these things, and knowing exactly what is going on in it is an anathema to me while the struggle with that unknowing-ness, the struggle to understand it, and the pleasure of failing, is part of what I adore about the subject. Esotericism and Mysticism abound in this worldview.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"Maria Popova <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/about/\">describes her work on <em>The Marginalian</em> </a> as 'a record of my reading and reckoning with our search for meaning'.\n\nI would describe my music as almost exactly the same - a record of my reckoning with our search for meaning - meaning felt, not thought, expressed, not spoken.\n\n Popova, to my delight, goes further: 'our search for meaning: sometimes through science and philosophy, sometimes through poetry… always through the lens of wonder.'\n\n(-Chris)",
"My Music is both my reflection on and my reflection of the beauty in the world around me.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I think, often of the genre and translation of Zuihitsu ('follow the brush'). I think if I invented a musical genre for my work it would be Zuihitsu - follow the brush.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If narrative is ‘an organised sequence of events with a beginning, a middle, and an end' then I wonder about what a koan is, and a musical koan. Is that what I want to write? Sometimes? I think maybe that’s what I would call my musical ‘threads’. Do I string them together into sequences? Can I? Do I want to? I'm not sure.\n\n(-Chris)",  
"'The speculative, in fiction or poetry, deals with a world that is different from the one we experience in at least one way. It may be the same world in the future, or a different world.' - From ‘Stars Like Sand: Australian Speculative Poetry' by by Tim Jones , and P. S. Cottier.\n\nDo I write speculative music?\n\n(-Chris)",
"I have always felt, even when unable to articulate or be entirely conscious of it, that there is 'something more' in the world, in our experience, something that is 'beyond'. Music is the more tangible thing I know that directly engages with this beyond, and so music for me is what other spiritual practice - religion, capitalism, etc. - is for others. It fills that spiritual dimension that we are, these days, embarrassed to discuss because it doesn’t have an obvious place in the scientific-rationale, post-enlightenment cultural west.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write 'just the kind of sound I had long looked for - a mysterious, complex sound with an intangible, enigmatic harmony which I found intensely beautiful', to appropriate the words of the British composer Reginald Smith Brindle (having just heard ‘The Prisoner’ by Dallapiccola.\n\n(-Chris)",
"This is a tractate on my music, but not tractate in the usual usage.\n\nIn his 'A Tractate on Japanese Aesthetics', Donald Richie notes 'Among other ideas, Eastern aesthetics suggests that ordered structure contrives, that logical exposition falsifies, and that linear, consecutive argument eventually limits.' He He then presents <em>his</em> tractate in the as being in the spirit of the <em>Zuihitsu</em> - a word translated from the Japanese as ‘essay’ but nonetheless completely different from the western meaning of the word ‘essay’, with differing shades of meaning and histories.\n\nIn particular, Richie mentions the Japanese use of ‘juxtaposition, for assembling, for bricolage… Many Japanese writers prize a quality of indecision in the structure of their work. And something too logical, too symmetrical is successfully avoided when writers ignore suppositions of the questions asked of them. It is then not the assumptions of the writer’s controlling mind that are followed by, as the Japanese phrase it, the brush itself’ before evoking Zuihitsu again - ‘following the brush, allowing it to lead. The structure is the multiplicity of strokes that make up the aesthetic quality, one which they imply and which we infer.’\n\n(-Chris)",
"My gift from my mentor Nigel Butterley - my musical inheritance - is less about style per se (although we certainly share some values about harmony and musical affect), but more about mindset and outlook, both on art and the mystical more generally.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I’m often asked what my music is ‘about’. You know those unutterable, guttural, thoughts - the visceral ones without words - that well up inside of you, but have no expression or articulation? The ones that wake you in the night in fear, in wonder, in awe, with love, fear, and every possible configuration and reconfiguration of the universe beyond your mortal mind and self, but also enveloping them and enveloped by them?\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s poetic music. If you accept that poetry can get at things that prose cannot - and I do accept that it does, not always directly, not always rationally, but it does it just the same - then I think about my music in the same way. It is about accessing things that are beyond the mundane, that are lost in more prosaic forms. Brain and heart, body and soul, all the way down. \n\nAnd, as Borges had it - 'life is, I am sure, made of poetry'.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think about my music the same way Maria Popova thinks about poetry - 'under its slow seduction, I came to see how it shines a sidewise gleam on the invisible and unnameable regions of being where the truest truths dwell, the most difficult and the most beautiful; how it sneaks in through the backdoor of consciousness to reveal us more fully to ourselves; how it gives us an instrument for paying attention, which is how we learn to love the world more… a way of finding the intimate in the universal and the universal in the intimate.'\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think I am, at least in part, a neo-transcendentalist, inasmuch as I believe in the unity of science, spirituality, love, and art in the construction of a meaningful life.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Messiaen, arguing <em>against</em> a description of himself as a mystical musician (which, in any case, he is), stated that ‘I am not a mystical musician, but a Surrealist musician who exceeds his desire for the Surreal by the supernatural’. It's a marvellous denial that confirms what it's denying, while also deepening and enriching it. I have a profound symapthy for the idea of a Surrealist who exceeds his desire for the Surreal by the supernatural.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In my homeland, there’s a bird called a lyrebird that collects beautiful things and arranges them as a nesting place. I’m a lyrebird.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The aim of my music is to add poetry to the world in the language I find most potent.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that takes you out of yourself.",
"If language delineates identity, and in delineating both fortifies and creates it, music has the potential to free us of this, just as it has the potential to similarly fortify and create.\n\nPut simply, I think music is the most powerful and magic substance in the universe. It does many things, it can do many things, and it is irreducible.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The people who write music like music I write are no good at simple answers, so it may be no coincidence that we lack a good description of the music we write.\n\n(-Chris)",
"An attempt to reserve an autonomous status for art can’t *just* be insidious/malignant. Of course it is if it's in the pursuit of erasure (or even if it does this incidentally), but that - or fear of that - can’t preclude contemplative purity as a pursuit, can it?\n\nI think it was transgressive, when I was being musically educated at a tertiary level, to say I liked a piece - a piece was either good (worthy), or not. I think this was a toxic result of the Idea of Art linked to the negative side of Art for Art’s sake (the autonomous status for art), but declaring a subject with desires - the ‘I’ who likes and dislikes a piece - has to also allow for a healthy space for <em>musical contemplation</em>, freed - if desired or desirable - from other ‘un-artly’ concerns, it just can’t - and shouldn’t - preclude other conditions of musical being in its wake and it has to accept the conditions of such a state, that it might just as easily be rejoiced in as rejected for its claims to autonomy.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There’s a whole lot of noise out there (not literal noise - but there’s a lot of that too), and ultimately you have to live (live with yourself) so you have to create what let’s you live (with yourself). Ultimately, I think your art is about being honest (with yourself, and the world), and holding on to the things you genuinely love, while not worrying about the incessant noise. That’s all distraction.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Perhaps I want to imitate the best part of the best <em>artificial</em> intelligence in my work, or at least way of working - combining impossibly and inexplicably disparate cultural objects into a new whole.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is about finding connections and connection.\n\nJust as I contain multitudes, I have lived many lives and my music is therefore not singular but struggling towards that absence.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There’s a large mound of earth on the Orkney islands. We have no written record from the people who built it - how they built it, or why - but we know it took a lot of serious and hard work to construct, and that it’s a magic place, deliberately built to capture and deify light with the passing of time. It’s inexplicable, but despite this deeply moving and meaningful. This, for me, is the very best music and the kind of music I always try to write. It’s hard work, it’s inexplicable, but it is driven by an unknown sense of purpose and necessity with a view to adding to the wonder of the earth, by drawing from its immeasurable well.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/09/aaron-copland-creative-experience/\">speaking about American composer Aaron Copland, says</a> \"More than the mere exorcism of emotion, Copland argues that the magic of music lies in its ability to translate our concrete thoughts and feelings into an enchanting abstract experience\".\n\nLater on, quoting Copland directly, she notes how \"everyone is supposed to like music, but people who are really musically gifted don’t seem to have the need for having music’s significance made specific. They can think about music and enthuse about it, and that’s all that’s necessary… One of the reasons why cultivated music is one of the glories of mankind… is that we are dealing in amorphous, highly abstract material without any specific thought content.\"\n\nElsewhere, Copland says \"The arts in general, I think, help to give significance to life. That’s one of their very basic and important functions.\"\n\nSo what do I want my music to be? ‘An enchanting abstract experience, free from specific significance but not free from significance - an amorphous, highly abstract material without any specific thought content, giving significance to life…'\n\n(-Chris)",
"I have a desperate need to make non-obvious connections between materials and ideas, and music is the way that I do this.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From a poem by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/07/05/let-the-last-thing-be-song/\">Hannah Fries</a> :\n\n<strong>Let the last thing be song</strong>\n\nii.\nWhat is left in one\nWho does not remember?\nLove and music.\n\nNot a name but the fulness.\n\n...",
"Burke said, of politicians - ‘Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays you instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.’ It’s not an opinion, I think, that would be widely well-received today, and I hate to compare my work to a politician's work, but I think the same holds true of an artist - I owe you my industry and judgement, even if - unfortunately - you don’t like the results, and to do otherwise is to betray you instead of serving you.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/10/10/a-private-history-of-happiness/\">speaking about Petrarch, sums up my own feelings about composer:</a>\n\n\"In a letter to his friend, abbot Peter of St. Benigno in Italy, poet and scholar Francesco Petrarca celebrates the relentless rewards of writing:\n\n<em>Strangely enough I long to write, but do not know what or to whom. This inexorable passion has such a hold upon me that pen, ink, and paper, and work prolonged far into the night, are more to my liking than repose and sleep. In short, I find myself always in a sad and languishing state when I am not writing, and, anomalous though it seems, I labour when I rest, and find my rest in labour. My mind is hard as rock, and you might well think that it really sprang from one of Deucalion’s stones.\n\nLet this tireless spirit pore eagerly over the parchment, until it has exhausted both fingers and eyes by the long strain, yet it feels neither heat nor cold, but would seem to be reclining upon the softest down. It is only fearful that it may be dragged away, and holds fast the mutinous members. Only when sheer necessity has compelled it to quit does it begin to flag. It takes a recess as a lazy ass takes his pack when he is ordered up a sharp hill, and comes back again to its task as a tired ass to his well-filled manger. My mind finds itself refreshed by prolonged exercise, as the beast of burden by his food and rest. What then am I to do, since I cannot stop writing, or bear even the thought of rest? I write to you, not because what I have to say touches you nearly, but because there is no one so accessible just now who is at the same time so eager for news, especially about me, and so intelligently interested in strange and mysterious phenomena, and ready to investigate them.\"</em>\n\n(-Chris)",
"A family friend, a catholic priest (and a very good musician), once asked me - knowing I had no conventional religious affinity - what I made of the ‘big stuff’ (life, death, etc.). It was an honest inquiry, without expectation, just honest curiosity. I answered that music is basically my answer to the big stuff, and it seemed a plausible answer for someone steeped in both formal religion and music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My current work is - really, at base - nothing more and nothing less than judging timings. How long should an idea go on, how should it balance against the duration of a different idea. How do they collide? What’s the energy across the longer timespan of a piece? These are the questions that obsess me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am interested in intricate and interwoven layers of meaning from the personal to the universal, allusions that point in many directions at once, rich with meaning and potential meaning.\n\nMy first string quartet, <em>The true ceremony of the sun</em>, that I'm working on now generates meaning on multiple levels for me - personal, interpersonal, formal, narrative, intimate and universal. This is what interests me about it - and about music more generally.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "At base, I will never get over - can never get over - what music is capable of doing to someone, it’s an incredibly powerful, intangible thing.\n\n(-Chris)"
