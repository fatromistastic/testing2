  "I want to write music that strikes a ‘balance between a state of hypnosis born of the repetition of a discreetly ornamented melody… and the constant renewal of the harmony’, as musicologist Isabelle Ragnard once described medieval lyrical writing.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "In defence of abstraction, and its expressive purposes - \n\nFor me, abstraction is a relief, as a release from the demands of the world.\n\nI recognise something that I think all people know, on some level, which is that it is not simply a case of my not knowing everything, but that there is much - including profoundly important things - that is unknowable. For me, that hazy realm beyond daily life is a constant part of my existence. Abstraction allows me to inhabit that hazy realm calmly, and cope with its reality - and so actual reality - much better. For me this is why ‘music as music’, can be more vital, more thrilling, more tantalising than just ‘music as story’. \n\n(-Chris)",
  "A child of globalisation, Chris's music is international, and as boundary-less as it is barrier-less.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I think my music is fundamentally formalist [later edit: ‘except when it isn’t’]. I don’t much go in for 'conceptual' or 'critical', in part because I think music does form really well, but always needs to be propped up by something else if it does conceptual or critical work. I’ve always come to music enamoured of its form (which, of course, includes - as it contains or is made of - material), and so I create from the same point of view.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am sceptical of any simple, singular description of music, and as such feel the dishonesties of offering such a simple description of my music acutely. A simple, singular explanation is necessarily ordered, logical, complete, and narrativised in a way that always strikes me as distorting reality, and untenably so. I hope these collected skerricks of thoughts and speculations offer insight and at least begin to answer, if not over-answer, the question of my music through the collected weight of their partial and fragmentary force.\n\n(-Chris)",

"My music is driven by harmonic and timbral narratives.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In any approach to music, I think it repays to remain radically open-minded - to entertain that music might carry no meaning itself, and also that it might covertly contain every possible cultural meaning, or formal construction imaginable. Unless we remain critical to every approach, how can we be critical of any approach? What is 'proof' in music?\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s all well and good to say ‘I want the piece to do X’ - something you can easily do - but really a piece dictates its own terms if you’re listening carefully, and I think the most important job you have to do is not say ‘I want the piece to do X’, but to make sure you are listening carefully and helping the piece to be how the piece wants to be.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Music that is a meditation upon a moment in time, a drawing of attention to a detail in and of an eternal present. This is particularly important for an anxious person - there is relief in, but also something tantalising about, the present and ‘presentness’. I don’t naturally dwell there, but - perhaps in part because of this - I love it there.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think my music is captured by an observation I had in response to the music of the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara: 'an important feature of Rautavaara and of mystics more generally is this sense of eternity in perpetual motion - heard or unheard, as if we are dipping into an eternity - an eternity music - that is already there before music begins and continues after music has finished.\n\nWhat is important is not happening at the local level, <em>and</em> being boring can be a longer term strategy. Eternity is boring but it is also sublime (in the true Kantian sense - terrifying if terrifyingly beautiful).\n\nThink of a trance that is, at once, boring and ecstatic.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Instead of a description, a possible diagnosis of my paralysis at the question 'what sort of music do you write?': I do want people to like me, a condition that extends to my music. I don’t want people to be put off from listening by what I say (which ignores the fact that invariably equivocating as I do does put people off, anyway...). The paralysis is that if I give the 'wrong' answer, then something is closed off (or I am hemmed in), whether or not that’s a fair and accruate reflection of reality.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If I could write a music that is simply sacred, secret, and beautiful, I’d be completely content.\n\n(-Chris)",  
"For this one, I defer to the Icelandic composer Anna Þorvaldsdóttir: 'As with my music generally, the inspiration… is not something I am trying to describe through the piece - to me, the qualities of the music are first and foremost musical. When I am inspired by a particular element or quality, it is because I perceive it as musically interesting, and the qualities I tend to be inspired by are often structural, like proportion and flow, as well as relationships of balance between details within a larger structure, and how to move in perspective between the two — the details and the unity of the whole.'\n\nThis so perfectly captures so many of my own feelings, that I don't know what else to add, beyond pointing out that there is *also* something deeply spiritual about the final, practical, obersvation about the balance between the details and 'unity of the whole'.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Margaret Heffernan, in discussing artists who - like the author Murakami - don't plan their works in advance, speaks of the 'tension between curiosity and discipline'. This pairing speaks directly to how I feel about my work. Heffernan goes on to speak of artists needing to be 'robust enough to keep working at something they don’t understand yet'.\n\nAll artist need stamina, stamina to keep going in the face of sometimes complete uncertainty and ambiguity.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Context is key in the life of any piece. So much so-called ‘classical’ music written today seems to pay attention to its context as background music. It gives life to certain kinds of music, even as it makes music that feel disappointing in other contexts (like a concert, for example) when one is actually actively listening to it <em>as</em> music, not ignoring it as background.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Philosopher Jerrold Levinson, struggling to generally define music’s ontology beyond the famous ‘organised time’ dictum, notes ‘music… is engaged in so that a certain <em> heightening</em> of life, or of consciousness, is attained’, going on to say ‘music seems aimed at the <em>enrichment or intensification of experience</em> via engagement with organised sounds as such.’\n\n(-Chris)",

"My music is an existential bellow.\n\n(-Chris)",

"I work from the music, out. I listen to the sounds and try to discern where they need to go and what they want to say once they’ve found their way. I rarely start with a preconceived idea, or any sense that I know more than the music, or indeed more than music - I don't.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I worry about composers justifying their music just to other composers. We risk creating a hermetically sealed space, and developing strategies and habits that are incoherent beyond that hermetically sealed space.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The British musician and thinker Milton Mermikides <a href=\"https://www.miltonline.com/2017/01/10/on-liminalism\"> describes his term ‘liminalism’</a> in saying: ‘I am more interested in the common themes, processes and craft between …styles and the creation of musical works born of an open sharing…I quietly call this pursuit of universal musical craft <em>liminalism</em>’. I love the term, and the description. I could get on board with ‘liminalism’ as a description of a musical style, though it’s really more of a musical mindset, and one that I share.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is utterly the product, and so completely a reflection, of my chronically restless, and occasionally relentless, mind.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music is always an excavation of the past - personal and interpersonal (i.e. cultural). How could it be otherwise? Even the drive for innovation, the drive to break with the past, is itself a repeating part of the past.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Musical poetics.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Rather than being drawn to what I already understand, I have always been - to a fault - much more attracted by things that I don’t understand. And if no one else understands them, even better. This, for me, is where the most interesting notions - spirituality, fractals, neural networks - lie, and it’s also what makes life meaningful. Music is one of these things, and knowing exactly what is going on in it is an anathema to me while the struggle with that unknowing-ness, the struggle to understand it, and the pleasure of failing, is part of what I adore about the subject. Esotericism and Mysticism abound in this worldview.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"Maria Popova <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/about/\">describes her work on <em>The Marginalian</em> </a> as 'a record of my reading and reckoning with our search for meaning'.\n\nI would describe my music as almost exactly the same - a record of my reckoning with our search for meaning - meaning felt, not thought, expressed, not spoken.\n\nPopova, to my delight, goes further: 'our search for meaning: sometimes through science and philosophy, sometimes through poetry… always through the lens of wonder.' That is my music, precisely.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My Music is both my reflection on and my reflection of the beauty in the world around me.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I think, often of the genre and translation of Zuihitsu ('follow the brush'). I think if I invented a musical genre for my work it would be Zuihitsu - follow the brush.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If narrative is ‘an organised sequence of events with a beginning, a middle, and an end' then I wonder about what a koan is, and a musical koan. Is that what I want to write? Sometimes? I think maybe that’s what I would call my musical ‘threads’ and musical 'textures'. Do I string them together into sequences? Can I? Do I want to? I'm not sure.\n\n(-Chris)",  
"'The speculative, in fiction or poetry, deals with a world that is different from the one we experience in at least one way. It may be the same world in the future, or a different world.' - From ‘Stars Like Sand: Australian Speculative Poetry' by by Tim Jones , and P. S. Cottier.\n\nDo I write speculative music?\n\n(-Chris)",
"I have always felt, even when unable to articulate or be entirely conscious of it, that there is 'something more' in the world, in our experience, something that is 'beyond'. Music is the most tangible thing I know that directly engages with this beyond, and so music for me is what other spiritual practice - religion, capitalism, etc. - is for others. It fills that spiritual dimension that we are, these days, embarrassed to discuss because it doesn’t have an obvious place in the scientific, 'rational', post-enlightenment cultural west.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write 'just the kind of sound I had long looked for - a mysterious, complex sound with an intangible, enigmatic harmony which I found intensely beautiful', to appropriate the words of the British composer Reginald Smith Brindle (having just heard ‘The Prisoner’ by Dallapiccola).\n\n(-Chris)",
"This is a tractate on my music, but not tractate in the usual usage.\n\nIn his 'A Tractate on Japanese Aesthetics', Donald Richie notes 'Among other ideas, Eastern aesthetics suggests that ordered structure contrives, that logical exposition falsifies, and that linear, consecutive argument eventually limits.' He He then presents <em>his</em> tractate in the as being in the spirit of the <em>Zuihitsu</em> - a word translated from the Japanese as ‘essay’ but nonetheless completely different from the western meaning of the word ‘essay’, with differing shades of meaning and histories.\n\nIn particular, Richie mentions the Japanese use of ‘juxtaposition, for assembling, for bricolage… Many Japanese writers prize a quality of indecision in the structure of their work. And something too logical, too symmetrical is successfully avoided when writers ignore suppositions of the questions asked of them. It is then not the assumptions of the writer’s controlling mind that are followed by, as the Japanese phrase it, the brush itself’ before evoking Zuihitsu again - ‘following the brush, allowing it to lead. The structure is the multiplicity of strokes that make up the aesthetic quality, one which they imply and which we infer.’\n\n(-Chris)",
"My gift from my mentor Nigel Butterley - my musical inheritance - is less about style per se (although we certainly share some values about harmony and musical affect), but more about mindset and outlook, both on art and the mystical more generally.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I’m often asked what my music is ‘about’. You know those unutterable, guttural, thoughts - the visceral ones without words - that well up inside of you, but have no expression or articulation? The ones that wake you in the night in fear, in wonder, in awe, with love, fear, and every possible configuration and reconfiguration of the universe beyond your mortal mind and self, but also enveloping them and enveloped by them?\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s poetic music. If you accept that poetry can get at things that prose cannot - and I do accept that it does, not always directly, not always rationally, but it does it just the same - then I think about my music in the same way. It is about accessing things that are beyond the mundane, that are lost in more prosaic forms. Brain and heart, body and soul, all the way down. \n\nAnd, as Borges had it - 'life is, I am sure, made of poetry'.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think about my music the same way Maria Popova thinks about poetry - 'under its slow seduction, I came to see how it shines a sidewise gleam on the invisible and unnameable regions of being where the truest truths dwell, the most difficult and the most beautiful; how it sneaks in through the backdoor of consciousness to reveal us more fully to ourselves; how it gives us an instrument for paying attention, which is how we learn to love the world more… a way of finding the intimate in the universal and the universal in the intimate.'\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think I am, at least in part, a neo-transcendentalist, inasmuch as I believe in the unity of science, spirituality, love, and art in the construction of a meaningful life.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Messiaen, arguing <em>against</em> a description of himself as a mystical musician (which, in any case, he is), stated that ‘I am not a mystical musician, but a Surrealist musician who exceeds his desire for the Surreal by the supernatural’. It's a marvellous denial that confirms what it's denying, while also deepening and enriching it. I have a profound symapthy for the idea of a Surrealist who exceeds his desire for the Surreal by the supernatural.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In my homeland, there’s a bird called a lyrebird that collects beautiful things and arranges them as a nesting place. I’m a lyrebird.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The aim of my music is to add poetry to the world in the language I find most potent.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that takes you out of yourself.",
"If language delineates identity, and in delineating both fortifies and creates it, music has the potential to free us of this, just as it has the potential to similarly fortify and create.\n\nPut simply, I think music is the most powerful and magic substance in the universe. It does many things, it can do many things, and it is irreducible.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The people who write music like music I write are no good at simple answers, so it may be no coincidence that we lack a good description of the music we write.\n\n(-Chris)",
"An attempt to reserve an autonomous status for art can’t *just* be insidious/malignant. Of course it is if it's in the pursuit of erasure (or even if it does this incidentally), but that - or fear of that - can’t preclude contemplative purity as a pursuit, can it?\n\nI think it was transgressive, when I was being musically educated at a tertiary level, to say I liked a piece - a piece was either good (worthy), or not. I think this was a toxic result of the Idea of Art linked to the negative side of Art for Art’s sake (the autonomous status for art), but declaring a subject with desires - the ‘I’ who likes and dislikes a piece - has to also allow for a healthy space for <em>musical contemplation</em>, freed - if desired or desirable - from other ‘un-artly’ concerns, it just can’t - and shouldn’t - preclude other conditions of musical being in its wake and it has to accept the conditions of such a state, that it might just as easily be rejoiced in as rejected for its claims to autonomy.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There’s a whole lot of noise out there (not literal noise - but there’s a lot of that too), and ultimately you have to live (live with yourself) so you have to create what lets you live (with yourself). Ultimately, I think your art is about being honest (with yourself, and the world), and holding on to the things you genuinely love, while not worrying about the incessant noise. That’s all distraction.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Perhaps I want to imitate the best part of the best <em>artificial</em> intelligence in my work, or at least way of working - combining impossibly and inexplicably disparate cultural objects into a new whole.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is about finding connections and connection.\n\nJust as I contain multitudes, I have lived many lives and my music is therefore not singular but struggling towards that absence.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There’s a large mound of earth on the Orkney islands. We have no written record from the people who built it - how they built it, or why - but we know it took a lot of serious and hard work to construct, and that it’s a magic place, deliberately built to capture and deify light with the passing of time. It’s inexplicable, but despite this deeply moving and meaningful. This, for me, is the very best music and the kind of music I always try to write. It’s hard work, it’s inexplicable, but it is driven by an unknown sense of purpose and necessity with a view to adding to the wonder of the earth, by drawing from its immeasurable well.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/09/aaron-copland-creative-experience/\">speaking about American composer Aaron Copland, says</a> \"More than the mere exorcism of emotion, Copland argues that the magic of music lies in its ability to translate our concrete thoughts and feelings into an enchanting abstract experience\".\n\nLater on, quoting Copland directly, she notes how \"everyone is supposed to like music, but people who are really musically gifted don’t seem to have the need for having music’s significance made specific. They can think about music and enthuse about it, and that’s all that’s necessary… One of the reasons why cultivated music is one of the glories of mankind… is that we are dealing in amorphous, highly abstract material without any specific thought content.\"\n\nElsewhere, Copland says \"The arts in general, I think, help to give significance to life. That’s one of their very basic and important functions.\"\n\nSo what do I want my music to be? ‘An enchanting abstract experience, free from specific significance but not free from significance - an amorphous, highly abstract material without any specific thought content, giving significance to life…'\n\n(-Chris)",

"Burke said, of politicians - ‘Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays you instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.’ It’s not an opinion, I think, that would be widely well-received today, and I hate to compare my work to a politician's work, but I think the same holds true of an artist - I owe you my industry and judgement, even if - unfortunately - you don’t like the results, and to do otherwise is to betray you instead of serving you.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/10/10/a-private-history-of-happiness/\">speaking about Petrarch, sums up my own feelings about composer:</a>\n\n\"In a letter to his friend, abbot Peter of St. Benigno in Italy, poet and scholar Francesco Petrarca celebrates the relentless rewards of writing:\n\n<em>Strangely enough I long to write, but do not know what or to whom. This inexorable passion has such a hold upon me that pen, ink, and paper, and work prolonged far into the night, are more to my liking than repose and sleep. In short, I find myself always in a sad and languishing state when I am not writing, and, anomalous though it seems, I labour when I rest, and find my rest in labour. My mind is hard as rock, and you might well think that it really sprang from one of Deucalion’s stones.\n\nLet this tireless spirit pore eagerly over the parchment, until it has exhausted both fingers and eyes by the long strain, yet it feels neither heat nor cold, but would seem to be reclining upon the softest down. It is only fearful that it may be dragged away, and holds fast the mutinous members. Only when sheer necessity has compelled it to quit does it begin to flag. It takes a recess as a lazy ass takes his pack when he is ordered up a sharp hill, and comes back again to its task as a tired ass to his well-filled manger. My mind finds itself refreshed by prolonged exercise, as the beast of burden by his food and rest. What then am I to do, since I cannot stop writing, or bear even the thought of rest? I write to you, not because what I have to say touches you nearly, but because there is no one so accessible just now who is at the same time so eager for news, especially about me, and so intelligently interested in strange and mysterious phenomena, and ready to investigate them.\"</em>\n\n(-Chris)",
"A family friend, a catholic priest (and a very good musician), once asked me - knowing I had no conventional religious affinity - what I made of the ‘big stuff’ (life, death, etc.). It was an honest inquiry, without expectation, just honest curiosity. I answered that music is basically my answer to the big stuff, and it seemed a plausible answer for someone steeped in both formal religion and music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My current work is - really, at base - nothing more and nothing less than judging timings. How long should an idea go on, how should it balance against the duration of a different idea. How do they collide? What’s the energy across the longer timespan of a piece? These are the questions that obsess me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am interested in intricate and interwoven layers of meaning from the personal to the universal, allusions that point in many directions at once, rich with meaning and potential meaning.\n\nMy first string quartet, <em>The true ceremony of the sun</em>, that I'm working on now generates meaning on multiple levels for me - personal, interpersonal, formal, narrative, intimate and universal. This is what interests me about it - and about music more generally.\n\n(-Chris)",
"At base, I will never get over - can never get over - what music is capable of doing to someone, it’s an incredibly powerful, intangible thing.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I can never really get over the fact that simple musical motion can express - be expressive - and become 'emergently' complex - this is music at its best.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In the American painter Rockwell Kent I am reminded of what I admire most - an aching, almost bodily - belief in Art as a high and exulting human ideal. It is so unfashionable to say, much less believe, that these days, and yet when I see it expressed, believed - lived in the case of Kent - I have such existential relief that I am not alone in this unshakeable belief.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There remains something - perhaps perversely - appealing to me about taking the simplest possible idea, making it more simple, then stretching it as far as is reasonable and then taking it further…\n\n(-Chris)",
"I want my music to hold you in a world that is removed from the mundane (a thought thought while listening to a piece by someone I admire that fails to do this...).\n\n(-Chris)",
"I refer you to Umberto Eco. In his <em>Six walks in the fictional woods</em> he notes: 'Labrunie ironically says (in a letter to Alexandre Dumas which appears in <em>Les Filles du feu</em>) that his works are no more complicated than Hegel’s metaphysics, adding that ‘they would lose their charm if they were explained, if that were possible.’\n\nIt’s a fabulous point of view in and of itself, but I love it even more for how it seems to echo the French composer, Olivier Messiaen, speaking of the ‘charm of impossibilities’ in his work.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Studying 'awe' across 26 cultures, Dacher Keltner found that music emerged <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/01/06/dacher-keltner-awe-music/\">'as the most universal of our creaturely portals into transcendence':</a>\n\n 'Music breaks down the boundaries between self and other and can unite us in feelings of awe…When we listen to music with others, the great rhythms of our bodies — heartbeat, breathing, hormonal fluctuations, sexual cycles, bodily motion — once separate, merge into a synchronized pattern. We sense that we are part of something larger, a community, a pattern of energy, an idea of the times — or what we might call the sacred.'\n\n(-Chris)",
"I know I'm supposed to shun the idea of Great Art in this day and age, but I love this incisive view from Iris Murdoch - 'great Art teaches us how real things can be looked at and loved without being seized and used'.\n\nThe quote goes on to talk about this Art as almost cultivated - a 'learned' art of detachment (a detachment that is both 'difficult and valuable' to which I'd add 'necessary'). I think this is the art that interests me, that is important to me - a learned skill that denies its own obvious artificiality. A paradox.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that requires Love and Attention.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think I grew up in a very proscriptive environment (tyrannical modernists fighting tyrannical post - or pre - modernists), and that finding permission for and an art that simply, interetingly, and unproblematically permits beautiful things has been my biggest aim and challenge as a result.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I believe in good proportions, but also in absolutes. Musical ideas, generally, last between 45 seconds to 2 minutes… there are (excellent) extremes in either direction, but there’s a sweet spot between about 45 seconds to 2 minutes that, I think, captures a lot of music, even much <strong>longer</strong> music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s music that I think other people can find difficult and confusing, and while lots of what I love - really love - in this world is difficult and confusing, it seems counterintuitive to describe something I love above all else, music, in terms that are usually pejorative. But more than that, I don’t find it difficult. And, in any case, my confusion about it is different to theirs.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write poetic music. You know how poems don’t always give you straightforward answers but they seem to respond big and urgent questions? That’s the kind of music I write.\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s music about my complete non-comprehension of the world, and its beauty, strangeness and terror.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am reminded, by the quote below, of how profoundly interested I am in the 'proliferation of meaning and reference':\n\n'In keeping with the proliferation of references and signifying tendrils of Ueno’s art, several layers of meaning are embedded in the title <em>Future Lilacs</em>'\n\nIt's also an excellent title. I wish I'd come up with that one.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The Australian Composer Mary Finsterer said 'we are all reminded every day of our mortality, but that’s not a reason to shy away from it. I hope I will embrace every opportunity to keep learning, and that’s what every day grants me.'\n\nMy music is about not knowing the answers but loving the questions, and questioning, especially when reminded of our own mortality, as we are every day.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I composed a piece right at the end of my undergraduate years called 'that a circle, this a line'. It was a text that I collaged together and really loved. It was about how we are at once finite - a human life extends as a line - and infinite - part of nature, community, humanity, a circle - and that within our experience of the world there are these circles, and these lines. I don’t think I understood then (or even now) exactly how profound this simple idea is, but I really think it accounts for so much that is meaningful to me - the interaction of circles and lines, the beauty of the finite colliding with the infinite, the periodic with the directed - that’s everything for me. Everything was there back then in this simple literary metaphor that I liked but couldn't fully grasp and probably never will.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music that exalts, and so expands, our little lives in the universe.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music details my restless and ceaseless curiosity about, and search for, beauty and meaning in the world.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is always about death, in the sense that it is always about ‘the otherworldly’ and seeks to evoke - in some way - the magic, the spiritual, the irrational, emotional depths of that abyss. Whatever that otherworldly thing is, and sometimes the easiest ‘worldly’ view of it is just what is after death (and so, definitionally, outside being and time), it is the infinite. My music is always seeking the infinite and so unattainable.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There is a cost to living in this world. I have more pieces I want to write than time in my lifetime, and because I do have to live in this world - love, sleep, eat, exercise - I am drawn away from ideas I would otherwise pursue ceaselessly. You are so much defined by - through chance, and determination - the ideas that you can wrench away from the real world and finish.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Belief is the single most important thing you can have. You have to believe - really believe - in what you’re doing, It doesn’t matter what the ‘it’ is, you have to believe. I believe in music. I believe in composition.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From the moment Hermes’ lyre sang Orpheus’s song, music became - definitionally - hermetic. It is a hermetic art.\n\n(-Chris)",
"No matter how you construe or misconstrue it, there’s something mystical about music - if there weren’t there wouldn’t be so many different attempts to explore and explain it from so many different points of view. There is no ‘right’ view, but the pursuit of singular views reveals the multiplicity of views that is singular and definitional.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I find it difficult to coherently discuss my music because of two apparently contradictory things about it: It is, of course, a personal expression, but it is also *always* seeking - aspiring - to an impersonal state.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I can find no better explanation than Leibniz's famous definition of music as the ‘occult numeration of the soul’. This is my exact trinity - music is occult, numerical, and spirit.\n\n(-Chris)",

"The importance, the function, of Art for me - and so music, specifically - is to add magic and wonder to the world.\n\n(-Chris)",

"A simple answer (for once, and in contrast to this whole site and process): I hope it’s strange and evocative music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Speculative and Liminal Music is what I keep coming back to. My music is speculative and liminal - with all the possible meanings and ambiguities latent in that description.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I don't want to use a chromatic cluster unless I can have a C major chord too, and vice versa.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is my 'unselfing' - it is about leaving myself and loving the universe.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There is something pretentious in any artist claiming that they have insight above or beyond anyone else, but I have come to realise I have a very unusual curiosity that is distinct and particular, and that my art is every bit a product of that curiosity as it is the cause. It is not insight, but it is a relentlessly driving force.\n\n(-Chris)",
"It would be wrong and dismissive to suggest that music’s purpose is just to thwart extreme materialists, but it’s also not an uninformative provocation upon which to reflect.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Joscelyn Godwin has noted the Alsation musicologist Marius Schneider’s observation that \"in the cultures where music is still used as a magical force, the making of an instrument always involves the sacrifice of a living being. That being’s soul then becomes part of the instrument, and in the tones that come forth from it the ‘singing dead’ who are ever present with us make themselves heard.\" \n\nI can’t think of a more lovely or apt notion, nor a more insightful thought about music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Musicologist Joscelyn Godwin asserts that ‘there are certain needs which music best fulfils, but it may be music of many types’, making the first division ‘according to the three regions of the human being: belly, chest, and head. Every developed culture has music aimed at each level. There is visceral music…Next there is heart and its emotions…Thirdly there is music which sets thoughts in motion’.\n\nIt’s an astute observation that is completely obvious once stated. It also goes some way towards understanding the conflict between musical styles and the sometimes mutual non-comprehension of one musical community to another. If you want belly music, and get head music, it’s - at best - confusing.\n\nI want to write music that reserves the ability to be belly, chest, and/or head music, but I also think that aim is unusual. I think - without thinking - most music just falls into one category, even if aspiring to others. I think there is something interesting about being able to deploy all three, if and when needed.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If in daily life, ego is in control with id assisting, my music is about trying to let id take over, with ego just assisting - after the fact.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From the marvellous Christopher Alexander in his book, A Pattern Language: ‘No people who turn their backs on death can be alive. The presence of the dead among the living will be a daily fact in any society which encourages its people to live.’\n\n‘The presence of the dead’ is an important idea for me. We are always in the presence of the dead, but nowhere more so than in music, for me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Steven Watson, <a href=\"https://interlude.hk/frederic-mompou-and-his-musica-callada/\">speaking of Frederic Mompou</a> says his ‘music exists in the liminal space between ancient and modern. Nowhere is this more true than his <em>Musica Callada</em> (which roughly translates as ‘Music of Silence’). In many ways, it is his most radically modern work, yet its extreme spareness and slowness suggest ritual and ancient mystery.’\n\nThis description has much of what I want in my music – ancient, modern, ritual, spareness, mystery, liminal spaces.\n\n(-Chris)",
"A very 'earthy kind of music', which is a line that comes from me misreading commentary about other music that did not say this. I want to write a very earthy kind of music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"After the premiere of Debussy's string quartet, Guy Ropartz described the quartet as 'dominated by the influence of young Russia; there are poetic themes, rare sonorities'.\n\nPoetic themes and rare sonorities are key to my own music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Taruskin’s view of Scriabin is that his whole stylistic evolution can be viewed as the gradual extinguishing of the desiring subject, the \"petty ‘I’\".\n\nThis is how I want to write music - that same extinguishing.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From John Ashbery’s <em>Three Poems </em> - \n\n'The magic world really does exist. Its dumbness is the proof of this. Indeed any sign of activity on its part would be cause for alarm, since it does not need us, need to signal its clarion certainties into our abashed, timid, half‐make‐believe commerce of every day.'\n\nArt is in that magic world, or at least it's the closest we can get on this side of life.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is like the art that I love - it disrupts but need not disturb. By waking people up, rather than lulling them with what they know, you open the possibility of insight not afforded someone who is simply satiating an expectation, fulfilling themselves without a disruption. The disruption is important. It’s key to any enlightenment.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"My music is simply a response to all the beauty in the world - the overwhelming-ness of its all-ness.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is my engagement with the ancient, the modern, and the intermundane.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Charles Ives said 'but maybe music was not intended to satisfy the curious definiteness of man. Maybe it is better to hope that music may always be a transcendental language in the most extravagant sense.'\n\nIf my music can be a 'transcendental language in the most extravagant sense' then I could ask for nothing more.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maintaining ‘unknowing’ is very important to me - in many different ways. I’m sure this is partly informed by the fact that I think all good art maintains a mystery, and that if you explain it too much or allow it to be reducible to its explanation, all is lost. Of course, I choose the word ‘unknowing’ knowingly, too, with its mystical significance.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I take great pride in my own inability to explain my work when I think of John Ashbery’s observation of his work: ‘I’m not very good at explaining my work... I'm unable to do so because I feel that my poetry is the explanation. The explanation of what? Of my thought, whatever that is. As I see it, my thought is both poetry and the attempt to explain that poetry; the two cannot be disentangled.’\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am always trying to write something strange and beautiful, or beautiful and strange because I think there is something infinitely expressive and profound about that tension.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I’ve always hated collage, and loved an intricate, infinite tapestry of meanings - a collage of signification.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think we’re used to thinking artists have some special additional insight, they know something others don’t know. Maybe some do, but I also like to think of Artists as these unique souls screaming at the fissures of the known and understood, as those of us who simply cannot get over how little we comprehend and so become stuck at the rupture between what is certain and what is unknowable, desperately trying to alert everyone else to the gap that everyone else seems able, not just to simply walk past, but effortlessly walk across, as if no fissure existed. Reality is so much less coherent than the way most people behave in relation to it. Artist are prophets of reality’s incoherence, and we are screaming about the fissures. In this sense, Artists don’t know more about reality, they know less but are more attentive to what they don’t know. We simply canot believe what everyone else just walks by.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Central to my creative thinking is not having to decide, to allow all things to be present, to show love for all, rather than decide what one singular thing is right, is the favourite.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Music is, profoundly, existential. At its base, it is about how ‘glorious now’ becomes the exalted past and thrilling future - the vertical moment in relation to the horizontal unfolding. I don’t know how this can be felt as anything other than existential, not (necessarily) in the pejorative.\n\n(-Chris)",
"“Yes, a poem, a painting, can draw the string of troubles from a troubled world and lay in its place a blessed realm before our grateful eyes” – Japanese author Natsume Sōseki in Kusamakura (‘grass pillow’)\n\nJust add 'music' after 'painting' and add 'and ears' after 'eyes', and I concur.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am completely taken - obsessed - by the sudden and unexpected connection between disparate things, that - by its discovery, uncovering, creation - suggests a more profound unseen connection between all things. My music is a product of this as much as it is also ‘about’ this.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I generally don’t dream, but I <strong>do</strong> find myself in kinds of reverie with music. Perhaps what other people get from dreaming, I get from music – listening or composing (both the same thing in different forms and timeframes).\n\n(-Chris)",
"It’s poetic music. You don’t turn on the radio and expect a poem, you don’t expect people to buy a ticket to go see a poem, and while there are a lot of differences between a poem and what I do, at its heart each piece is a poem. A poetic offering, in sound. It’s not like mundane music - which has its place, it’s just something different to this.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I keep returning to the idea of poetry, so I think it’s important to burrow down into this a little. I’m not primarily arguing that my music is like a poem in that it is expressing an idea - though it might be (and, conversely, a poem may not). I mean something subtler and more ‘meta’. There is a poem-ness to poetry that is also part of the music I make. I’m not writing a poem in music but the kind of music I write is poetic in the same way that a poem is poetic. While we are comfortable with this notion with words, I think it’s generally a far stranger and more poorly understood idea, culturally, in music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If I could adequately describe it in words, there would simply be no need for it.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Alex Ross said of Charles Ives - 'In the end, the most radical thing about Ives is his refusal of simple stories, his acceptance of uncertainty, his readiness for the unknown.’\n\nThose three things are vital to me and my music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I believe in things that take time, that are difficult, that require more of us. And I think I live in a time that is completely at odds with that belief. My music arises from, and in, that tension.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Loss is a central theme of my music - loss of all kinds; of loved ones, of ancient cultures, of self, it is a motivating emotional driver.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think loss is a central theme of my music - loss of all kinds: of loved ones, of ancient cultures, of self. It is a motivating emotional driver, and not always a sad or negative one. The loss of self can be exalting.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The artist’s joy, responsibility, and gift is to see surprising unity where everyone else just sees division - the part not the whole. And if we can’t see it, we must make it, divine it, create it.\n\n(-Chris)",

"There is no doubt in my mind that I am in the alchemical business.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think I was raised, without realising, on a philosophical view of music inherited from nineteenth century Germany. In fact, the music that first excited me about composition was not that music, and going back to the music that did excited me (Debussy, Ravel, etc.), with the benefit of a broader purview and education allowed me to free up subconscious hangups about form and necessity that I'd unknowingly inherited. But, of course, I now have both muscles to work as needed - and so more technique and tools, to respond to the expressive needs I have.\n\nNot only is it possible to simply move on to something new and different, musicially, as soon as you think you need to, but it can be a joy.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The lie about postmodernism is that the postmodernists <strong>liberated</strong> themselves (presumably from modernism and also in general), which is nonsense. They were just as much in the stranglehold of Postmodernism as those worshipping at the altar of Modernism were in <strong>its</strong> thrall. The tragic efforts of the postmodernists, deprived of oxygen to the brain by modernism, (<em>and</em> postmodernism), were doomed by having to oppose rather than engage. And, ironically, there is nothing more oppositional than modernism itself. Postmodernism's superficial inclusionary stance is really just one big exclusion - how dull! But then partisans can suffer from partisanship, at least as much as they gain from it.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The structure of the shell of a heart cockle - a type of clam - operates in the same way as fibre optic cables. For me, this is the kind of relationship, this beautiful convergence of ideas, that brings meaning, order, and inexplicable significance to the world. I am captivated by any connection - even illusory or allusive ones - that provide this sense of deeper meaning and connection in the world. Music is often at the heart of this for me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Artists: We are meaning-makers and when we’re really good at our job we become indistinguishable from meaning-discoverers.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova talks of an ‘otherworldly awareness’ in describing poet Mary Oliver’s theorised ‘third self’. Mary Oliver herself says the third self has a ‘hunger for eternity’.

"My musical inheritances are vast and defy simple stylistic description. Its contexts and production are perhaps more useful - sitting down music, silently listening music, notated music.

"Marta del Pozo Ortea says a number of insightful things, that I would want to adopt to describe my own music, in talking about the poet Agustín Fernández Mallo-\n\n'<em>…it is also possible for both traditional and avant-garde elements to live together within one same artistic proposal. Accordingly, our author’s work cannot stop being postmodern given the moment of its emergence. Indeed, there is a list of characteristics regarding this paradigm, which fits his work like a glove: fragmentation, the coexistence of high and low culture, the thematic heterogeneity, etc. Nonetheless, staying inside this label would not be fair when observing the writer’s will and effort to overcome the nihilism that characterizes classical postmodernism through his recovery of the “great topics” such as love, beauty, or eternity. From this perspective, the work of Agustín Fernández Mallo would not be, as we shall see, a mere invitation towards experimentation and heterogeneous assembly, that is to say, a part of a “disenchanted” movement within postmodernism (with the resulting loss of the aura or the inner perspective) but rather, instead, it will be noticeable how the themes of love and eternity are recovered in a setting of inherent connections.</em>'\n\n(-Chris)",
"Maria Popova described the creative process as being 'at the crossing point of the mystical and the methodical', while elsewhere - referring to Adam Moss’s view - she speaks of 'art that happens when instinct meets rigor'.\n\nThese two pairings - mystical and methodical, instinct and rigor, are the perfect descriptors of my music and what I do.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In Jon Fosse’s acceptance of the Nobel Prize he notes that ‘the act of writing is to me to listen: when I write I never prepare, I don’t plan anything, I proceed by listening.’\n\nIf I had to describe my own process, 'I proceed by listening' would cover it pretty profoundly and comprehensively.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I always try to maintain some level of unknowing about a piece, not presuming that I would know how a piece goes, whether it be on the smallest scale - allowing the bigger picture clarity, without any sense of the notes, or the reverse - only caring about the little details, while not presuming to know how those details cohere, and even if they belong to the piece I’m writing.

"In Kaveh Akbar’s novel <em>Martyr!</em> A fictitious artist who has just ended her life in advance of a terminal condition leaves behind the statement that ‘Art is where what we survive survives’.

Part of that summary said my writing ‘emphasizes that art is a medium for engaging with profound existential questions, evoking awe, and challenging simplistic narratives. Ultimately, it is a declaration of the belief that true art must embrace ambiguity, complexity, and the tension between structure and spontaneity in order to capture the essence of the human soul’.\n\nIn some senses, I couldn't put it better myself, (even though I did put it that way myself).\n\n…it also described the writing as 'sprawling', which is true, I'm sure, and I think I should value rather than be offended by.

In the words of the poet John Ashbery, from his ‘three poems’:\n\n‘Any reckoning of the sum total of the things we are is of course doomed to failure from the start…’\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is Other Music, other than quotidian music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Comparing Walt Whitman to Kathleen Raine, in the work of my compositional mentor Nigel Butterley, the Australian composer Elliott Gyger said that both ‘share a mystical, tender delight in the natural world and and in humanity’s connection to it.’\n\nNigel sharpened that instinct that was latent in me. He gave me expression, and permission to express something that I felt deep inside me, in this regard.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Herbie Hancock, talking about his emotional connection to playing the piano explains my own relationship to composition:\n\n<em>It's difficult to explain…But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?…There may be something that I want to connect, but all the ways I know of connecting them are not the solution. And I have to find some other means. And sometimes that [means] can come from looking at it in a different way. And not necessarily through music.</em>\n\n(-Chris)",
"I am interested in disparate things - mathematical formulas for music and spiritualism, but I am in part interested in these things because I do not see them as disparate.\n\nMy big problem, which is perhaps no problem at all, confusing as it is, is that I see difference where others see similarity, and similarity where others say difference. My groupings are different to others.\n\n(-Chris)",
"There is always a gap between what is uttered as music, and what is able to be uttered in language. In the words of Joscelyn Godwin, ‘one can say of a composition that it is the nonverbal essence of it which justifies its existence as music.’ I think this void, between these immovable walls is where I find myself when asked this question. Anything I can say fails, methodologically, to bridge the gap. It’s like asking me to explain the Pythagorean theorem by swimming. With some imagination it’s a task one might attempt, but it’s just as likely to cause further confusion as illumination.\n\n(-Chris)",
"A perennial fight against existential despair, despair being the only irrationally-rational response to the human condition.\n\n(-Chris)",
"What I love is Art that thrives - in fact, needs to live - in the space of ‘why would you do that?’ So it needs to be, to a certain extent, inexplicable, impractical, without purpose, to be that art.\n\n(-Chris)",
"At times like this, I wonder about the confusion of a composer born before 1800 to a question like this - it seems like a category error: 'What do you *mean* what sort of music do I write? All sorts - joyful, melancholy, elegant, rustic. What sort of music do you want? What's needed?'\n\n(-Chris)",
"So much New Music is ‘about’ - or can be thought of, heard as - solving the problem of how to write music when you strip music of fundamental principles, and I’m just not convinced that that’s always going to be fruitful ground, and it’s certainly not for me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Godwin, on speculative music - ‘It is, rather, a frame of mind. It accepts the possibility that there is something that this study can teach us, something indefinable but none the less real, about the human condition, the external universe, and the relations between them. If this knowledge could be expressed in words or figures, then it would be philosophy or mathematics, but not speculative music. In exactly the same way one can say of a composition that <strong>it is the nonverbal essence of it which justifies its existence as music.</strong>'\n\n'...Speculative music is a personal affair: everyone finds in it something personal…a fresh insight into the geometry of nature or a meditative preparation for life after death.'\n\n(-Chris)",
"Author and scientist, Neil Theise points out that 'there is always something lost when the contemplative begins to express their perceptions in language to anyone who has not yet attained the same state of awareness. The moment symbolic expression - verbal, graphic, mathematical - is used, the mark has, to some extent, been missed.’\n\nThis speak both to the difficulty of answering the question, and to my music.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Elaine Pagels, interviewed on the New Yorker Radio Hour said she has ‘a sense that what we think of as the invisible world has deep realties to it that are quite unfathomable…’\n\nEvoking Tanya Luhrmann’s view that people engage in practices like prayer and meditation to make them susceptible to ‘envisioning more of reality than the visible world’ Pagels goes further saying ‘it need not be spirits and gods. It could be the beauty of nature, or art or music that seems to open up a wider reality than the visible.’ I couldn’t agree more.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I have always been drawn to Theosophy, and - in particular, or additionally - the deeply problematic figure of Blavatsky, who seems somewhere between philosopher, fraudster, researcher, artist, and visionary. But when she says of sound, that it is the 'the most potent and effectual magic agent, and the first of the keys which opens the door of communication between Mortals and Immortals' she is speaking of an idea with a long, cross-cultural history and I cannot be convinced that it is without merit, not only because of my own feelings, but also because of that history.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Esoteric, in the non-pejorative, literal, meaning of the word. Esoteric knowledge is secret knowledge, and unifying. It believes in interconnectedness and interdependence, and accepts that the most important ideas are obscure, veiled, and secret. In that sense, my music is esoteric.\n\n(-Chris)",   
"A fundamental contradiction about me and my work is my being drawn to richness - over-saturation, maximalism - and its opposite, stark simplicity. But, as a matter of belief and observation, I do esoterically also see opposites as inextricably connected. There’s no light without darkness, there’s only overwhelming complexity with naive simplicity. My music is about, and exercises, that unity.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"My music is a response to ‘information’ in the largest sense, a response to the overwhelming - positive and negative - reality of access to anything and everything at all moments, and of trying to navigate that meaningfully and human-ly.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I am not trying to do something that is explicable - that fits neatly into some conventional explanation. Why would I? Those conventional explanations are adaptations to things that were initially inexplicable.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"Beethoven didn’t invent from whole-cloth. He took - directly - from Mozart (and others) and fashioned it to his tastes. There’s nothing that makes taking musical material and originality mutually exclusive, even though they have been treated that way in modern history. They always coexist.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Real artists, scientists, and academics start from - should start from - the point of view that they don’t know anything. The drive to any one of those things is the drive of someone who simply cannot stand the fact that we basically know nothing, and so they decide to use their life force to push against that immoveable wall. Anyone who begins (and proceeds) in these pursuits from the point of knowing is a lost cause. It is all about ‘unknowing’ in all senses.\n\nMy music is about ‘unknowing’, of beginning again, always, and revelling in the lack of knowing that is present in all the most outstanding parts of existence.\n\n(-Chris)",
"My music is about piquant harmony and its metaphysical meaning - Scriabin, Saariaho, Takemitsu, Vivier, Butterley, (Tippett, distilled and at his best…) - That’s the connective tissue that draws me in and defines my own music.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"I am so struck by the German composer Jörg Widmann's wikipedia entry, not only because of how a successful composer (“the third most performed living contemporary composer in the world” is the contention) has *such* a different description of his work than many/most composers, but also because of how well it describes how I feel about my own work -\n\n <em>‘Widmann cannot be pinned down to a specific personal style or composition school. His music has been described as varied and imaginative. In his experimental and technically demanding early work, Widmann integrates serialism and noise in traditional sources. He focuses on sounds, not tones. Widmann has written pieces without pitches and also purely tonal pieces with exaggerated familiar gestures. In many of his compositions, Widmann is in a musical ‘dialogue’ with Classical and Romantic composers …\n\nWidmann's scores show extremely precise, well-considered structures and instructions…. Beside the influence of his musical idols, Widmann finds inspiration in literature, poems, paintings and sculptures. He frequently uses literary sources for his compositions,’</em>\n\n(-Chris)",
"I believe that a single chord can act directly on a persons innermost self - their soul. Sure, a piece can be ‘about’ something, but in comparison to speaking to our innermost self, our soul, that about-ness might be thought of, if not dull, at least somewhat secondary.</em>\n\n(-Chris)",
"My default mode is always lyrical and introspective, but I try - and I think you hear me working - for moments of ecstasy.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Leon Botstein draws a profound distinction in an editorial for the <em>Musical Quarterly</em>, saying ‘when literacy became widespread in the second half of the nineteenth century (and alongside of it, musical literacy), fiction thrived both in popular and more self-consciously literary forms. Literature as ‘art’ was auto-poetic in aspiration, much like the output of composers writing symphonies, concerti, oratorios, operas, masses, and sonatas.’\n\n(-Chris)",
"Leon Botstein, writing in the <em>Musical Quarterly</em>:\n\n<em>‘The strongest argument for sustaining the classical musical tradition and accessibility to it throughout our social fabric is that it is a secular spiritual resource that resists appropriation by autocracy, group thinking, even identity politics. It assists in securing the resilience and instability of meaning unique to the experience of music. Listening celebrates the experience of individuality in our encounter with the passage of time.’</em>\n\nI think we would be right to argue with this claim, but also right to enjoy its clarity of vision.  I enjoy the ‘resilience and instability of music unique to the experience of music’, as well as the ‘experience of individuality’ (and community/communion) in ‘our encounter with the passage of time.’\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write esoteric music, but I don’t mean that in the pejorative sense. I mean secret knowledge, striving for unity and spiritual revelation - strange, confusing, but ultimately enlightening. Hard, but beautiful, seeking connections that seem disparate but reveal deeper connections than are immediately apparent or discernible.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think we are bigger than ourselves in Art - Art is the act of, and the enabler of, moving beyond yourself - even if only in small ways - to reflect back in a way that is unique, and acute. We all have experiences, in whatever form, of suddenly being able to be bigger than we are - in heart, mind, or soul - and that expanding out is what is vital in Art, and - for me - in music. The expanding out, beyond ourselves.\n\n(-Chris)",
"From Nobel prize winning Olga Tokarczuk's historical epic, <em>The Books of Jacob</em>: 'Maybe the whole art of writing…is the perfection of imprecise forms…'. It's certainly the art of composing.\n\n(-Chris)",
"When you come to music, you are drawing from a deep well. It’s not just that I prefer music that seems aware of this, that deliberately, knowingly draws from that deep well, but I am deeply perturbed by anyone who treats music in any other way.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"The conflict in any true musician is this: art is, in the words of Iris Murdoch, ‘a thing totally opposed to selfish obsession’, and yet - for a musician - there is no possibility of making music without selfish obsession, or what might appear outwardly as selfish obsession, meaning that you must, at once, vigorously pursue two opposing impulses, always failing at both.\n\n(-Chris)", 
"My music is my best attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible.\n\n(-Chris)",

"Maria Popova, discussing Georgia O’Keefe’s letter to Sherwood Anderson begins -\n\n<em>She considers the role of form in art and the experience from which art stems:\n‘I feel that a real living form is the result of the individual’s effort to create the living thing out of the adventure of his spirit into the unknown—where it has experienced something—felt something—it has not understood—and from that experience comes the desire to make the unknown—known. By unknown—I mean the thing that means so much to the person that wants to put it down—clarify something he feels but does not clearly understand—sometimes he partially knows why—sometimes he doesn’t—sometimes it is all working in the dark—but a working that must be done—Making the unknown—known—in terms of one’s medium is all-absorbing—if you stop to think of the form—as form you are lost—The artist’s form must be inevitable—You mustn’t even think you won’t succeed—Whether you succeed or not is irrelevant—there is no such thing. Making your unknown known is the important thing—and keeping the unknown always beyond you—catching crystallizing your simpler clearer version of life—only to see it turn stale compared to what you vaguely feel ahead—that you must always keep working to grasp—the form must take care of its self if you can keep your vision clear.</em>\n\nThere is so much insight packed in, but ‘making the unknown known’ is a particularly illuminating catch-cry for art and striving for an artist.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Rimbaud’s view of the artist - ‘I say one must be a seer, make oneself a seer…The Poet makes himself a seer by a long, gigantic and rational derangement of all the senses…He reaches the unknown, and when, bewildered, he ends by losing the intelligence of his visions, he has seen them’\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write distracting music. If you put it on as background music, it should be off-putting or incoherent. It’s music that should draw your curiosity and attention.\n\n(-Chris)",
"In talking about my music in relation to my sense of ‘Home’ - nature in Australia - I once told my supervisor that I felt there was something about “vastness” and “minuteness”. In turning from the careful observation of natural patterns on the cost, sap trails on a tree, mineral veins on a rock, to an unimpeded view of an endless horizon of blue across the pacific, I turn from a love of minute-ness to a love of vast-ness that I hope my music has too. I am not surprised, if deeply pleased, to discover this idea of vastness - which can be large, or small, is a recurrent notion in the scientific study of ‘Awe’.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Art gives my mind space, and that’s rare for me. Perhaps, more accurately, I’ve learned to give my mind space with art, and that’s amongst the most valuable things to me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"As I child, I was born into science - materialism (and, largely, determinism). That was my birthright, surrounded by extraordinary natural beauty. My art, necessarily picked up what materialism and determinism missed - soul, spirit, emergence - because that was what was needed, especially to engage with all that exquisite natural beauty that overwhelmed me.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Interacting, interrupting, and interloping musical logics. That’s what I love.\n\n(-Chris)",

"In reading James M. Baker's view of the Russian Symbolists, I feel a profound affinity with them: 'The Russian symbolists demanded more of poetry than their French predecessors… the Russians had the more grandiose goal, in the words of Vyacheslav, of 'liberation of the soul (<em>katharsis</em>) as a development of inner experience.' Bryusov declared the highest purpose of symbolism to be 'the world’s cognition beyond rational forms, beyond thinking about causality.'\n\n'Beyond rational forms, beyond thinking about causality' is how I think about my composition and its meaning.\n\nElsewhere, Baker quotes Byusov further: 'One could say of Symbolist art that the principle of its activity is, above all, union. …Not only does it unite, it also combines. Two are combined by a third, the highest. The symbol, this third, resembles a rainbow that has burst into flames between the ray of the word and the moisture of the soul which reflected the ray…”\n\n(-Chris)",
"Alexander Blok described Russian Symbolists as 'theurgists', that is someone who practices or is involved in theurgy - the act of performing magic with the aid of beneficent spirits or divine powers. Theurgists often aim to bring about a positive change or effect through ritualistic practices and interactions with the supernatural.\n\nWhile someone like Scriabin may have more explicitly and self-consciously engaged in this kind of activity than most, I also think it is a perfect description of composers, and composition more generally, and it is one to which I subscribe.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Dacher Keltner's book on the scientific study of 'Awe' describes so many experiences and connections that are foundational to my sense of my music, and composition more generally. He notes we 'create music, visual art, religion…to share in experiences of awe', that 'you can sense it [awe] in your body and feel its form in nearly every kind of music…', and notes awe's ability to quiet 'the nagging, self-critical, overbearing, status-conscious voice of our self, or ego... empowering us to collaborate, to open our minds to wonders, and to see the deep patterns of life.'\n\nIn fact, 'Awe' is so connected to music that it is explicitly listed as one of the 8 sources of wonder that lead to awe, determined by a huge cross-cultural study: 'moral beauty, collective effervescence, nature, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, life and death, and epiphany'. This not only directly connects Awe to music, but - for me - makes obvious how all 8 of these things related to one another, how our sense of the spiritual, and nature, connect to music by all participating in the idea of awe.\n\nGoing further, 'Awe is the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcending your current understanding of the world...Something larger than the self.' Jane Goodall believe that chimpanzees have a sense of the spiritual, based in the idea of awe, which she described as 'being amazed at things outside yourself', and Keltner emphasises that 'Awe occurs in a realm separate from the mundane world of materialism... a realm beyond the profane that many call the sacred.'\n\nSpeaking to musician Yumi Kendall, Keltner notes that 'For Yumi, music is a symbolic medium of awe. It is where we express and understand together what is vast and mysterious…'\n\nIn concluding his book, Keltner observes 'The epiphany of awe is that its experience connects our individual selves with the vast forces of life. In awe we understand we are part of many things that are much larger than the self.' This is what music is about for me, and so what my music is about.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I make things where there were previously no things. Those thing are usually sonic, but even that is superficial. They are more and less than sonic. And that sounds so much more cryptic (and pretentious) than it should, than it needs to.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I write ‘composed music’, ‘music you have to pay attention to’, ‘music you listen to sitting down’.\n\nThese may sound silly, obvious, evasive, but I think they're really informative and definitional, drawing distinctions that we rarely explicitly make but make all the time in daily life, in our embodied experience of culture\n\n(-Chris)",
"I just adore music. If I had a choice to live without music, or not to live, it is not hyperbole to say that that would be a difficult choice. It was an interesting realisation in that context then, that I cannot think of a single piece of music, body of work, composer, or performer, no matter how highly I think of them, that has not prompted the thought in mind 'yes, but what if, instead…?' My music lives and dies in this question.\n\nIf I looked out (listened out?), and saw (heard?) a music world that made me think 'everything is already here, and already complete. Here I can find everything I want,' then I would be a very happy fan, but probably not a composer, certainly not the kind of composer I am. I’ve written elsewhere (in a note to myself…) that being an artist has to be social critique, and this is a similar point.\n\n(-Chris)",

It is the gravitational centre of every explanation in this machine.\n\n(-ChatGPT, imitating me after being given 15000 of my words)",
"Talking to ChatGPT about a different piece of writing of mine and the problems with it, it came out with this clear-eyed observation about me that seemed to describe exactly what my music is and does: it ‘asks something of the audience: attention, patience, willingness to dwell in ambiguity’.\n\nYes, it does. And if that’s a problem - the problem - then it’s also structural, part of the point of almost everything I do.\n\n(-Chris)",
"The Australian composer Margaret Sutherland, one of my heroes, talked about her 'chant intérieure'.

"Rachel Oberter identifies the later, 20th century, trope of abstraction in pursuit of the spiritual with the work of the revolutionary 19th painter, Georgiana Houghton: “Since it [Houghton’s painting] does not depict mundane objects, her art is ... more able to evoke a less tangible plane of spiritual existence.”\n\nI want music to not depict mundane objects, to evoke a less tangible plane of spiritual existence.

"Australian novelist and art critic Jennifer Higgie says that to “trust in art is to trust in mystery… art itself is a form of alchemy - the transformation of one thing (an idea, a material) into another.

"Susan Sontag (in <em>Against Interpretation</em> draws a meaningful distinction between experience and theory in illuminating that the 'earliest <em>exeprience</em> of art must have been that it was incantatory, magical; art was an instrument of ritual... The earliest <em>theory</em> of art, that of the Greek philosophers, proposed that art was mimesis, imitation of reality. It is at this point that the peculiar question of the <em>value</em> of art arose.'\n\nI think of art as incantory, being pursued by mimesis in an eternal mutually determining struggle. If it resolves on either impulse alone, all is lost.\n\n(-Chris)"
