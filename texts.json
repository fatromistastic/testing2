  "I’m rarely trying to impress and amaze with my music - I'm much more interesting in being able to intrigue and allure.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Ultimately, composition requires either a lot of self-belief or a lot of self-flagellation. Self-belief is better, but harder.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Finding numinous moments.\n\n(-Chris)",
 "“Captivating” and “evocative” are what I <em>want</em> my music to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "My music is a deliberate (self-conscious?) and direct expression of time.\n\n(-Chris... a long time ago)",
  "Gloria Coates described her 4th Symphony as the “translation of a metaphysical experience into musical forms and content”. This is what I want all my music to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I want a music where a single dynamic can be heartbreaking, and I need a music where a basic detail like a dynamic can make a difference to a piece, have musical meaning.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Can you still write music that is compellingly gorgeous? I certainly hope so, because I want to do that.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I want to write music that strikes a ‘balance between a state of hypnosis born of the repetition of a discreetly ornamented melody…, on the one hand, and the constant renewal of the harmony … on the other’, as the musicologist Isabelle Ragnard described medieval lyrical writing.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "In defence of abstraction, and its expressive purposes - \n\nFor me, abstraction is a relief, as a release from the demands of the world.\n\nI recognise something that I think all people know, on some level, which is that it is not simply a case of my not knowing everything, but that there is much - including profoundly important things - that is unknowable. For me, that hazy realm beyond daily life is a constant part of my existence. Abstraction allows me to inhabit that hazy realm calmly, and cope with its reality - and so actual reality - much better. For me this is why ‘music as music’, can be more vital, more thrilling, more tantalising than just ‘music as story’. \n\n(-Chris)",
  "A child of globalisation, Chris's music is international, and as boundary-less as it is barrier-less.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I think my music is fundamentally formalist [later edit: ‘except when it isn’t’]. I don’t much go in for 'conceptual' or 'critical', in part because I think music does form really well, but always needs to be propped up by something else if it does conceptual or critical work. I’ve always come to music enamoured of its form (which, of course, includes - as it contains or is made of - material), and so I create from the same point of view.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I am sceptical of any simple, singular description of music, and as such feel the dishonesties of offering such a simple description of my music acutely. A simple, singular explanation is necessarily ordered, logical, complete, and narrativised in a way that always strikes me as distorting reality, and untenably so. I hope these collected skerricks of thoughts and speculations offer insight and at least begin to answer, if not over-answer, the question of my music through the collected weight of their partial and fragmentary force.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I contain multitudes\n\n(-Chris...quoting)",
  "Australian composer Matthew Shlomowitz theorises the 'capricious composer' in his article <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/its-not-about-you-do-we-still-need-an-artistic-voice/F38962E33164405DA089724DBFA8D22F\">\"IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU: DO WE STILL NEED AN 'ARTISTIC VOICE'?\"</a>, but I prefer to adopt and adapt the term 'curious composer' (not only for the inherent ambiguity) from his observation in the same article: 'a curious composer who explores different idioms is surely in step with the pluralist and decentred nature of the contemporary world.'\n\nI am a curious composer.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Music that is beyond the veil, rather than beyond the pale.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "William Butler Yeats said that \"in Ireland this world and the world we go to after death are not far apart.\"\n\nI want music that is in that closeness and so - somehow - beyond this world, between the worlds.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I think about what I do as musical poetry - there is absolutely musical prose, and it's different from what I do. I also remember W.B.Yeats in that same moment. Yeats said \"What can be explained is not poetry.\"\n\n(-Chris)",
  "It’s not pastiche and it’s not ironic. If it’s naive - so be it. It’s sincere and that’s all I care about. I *mean* it.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "My music is driven by harmonic and timbral narratives.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "In any approach to music, I think it repays to remain radically open-minded - to entertain that music might carry no meaning itself, and also that it might covertly contain every possible cultural meaning, or formal construction imaginable. Unless we remain critical to every approach, how can we be critical of any approach? What is 'proof' in music?\n\n(-Chris)",
  "It’s all well and good to say ‘I want the piece to do X’ - something you can easily do - but really a piece dictates its own terms if you’re listening carefully, and I think the most important job you have to do is not say ‘I want the piece to do X’, but to make sure you are listening carefully and helping the piece to be how the piece wants to be.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "I seek to find little bits of beauty in the world - cracks of unexpected light that contrast with the grey - and hold on to them, desperately, for as long as I possibly can.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Music that is magic, that is numinous - a numinous ground.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Expressive modernism - an apparent contradiction in terms. Modernism, in its true (so 'pure') form, should not express anything, right?\n\n(-Chris)",
"I try to compose glimpses of other worlds. For me it’s important that my music sits outside of everyday experience.\n\n(-Chris)",
  "Music that is a meditation upon a moment in time, a drawing of attention to a detail in and of an eternal present. This is particularly important for an anxious person - there is relief, but also something tantalising about the present and ‘presentness’. I don’t naturally dwell there, but - perhaps in part because of this - I love it there.\n\n(-Chris)",
"I think my music is captured by an observation I had in response to the music of the Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara: 'an important feature of Rautavaara and of mystics more generally is this sense of eternity in perpetual motion - heard or unheard, as if we are dipping into an eternity - an eternity music - that is already there before music begins and continues after music has finished.\n\nWhat is important is not happening at the local level, <em>and</em> being boring can be a longer term strategy. Eternity is boring but it is also sublime (in the true Kantian sense - terrifying if terrifyingly beautiful)\n\nThink of a trance that is, at once, boring and ecstatic.\n\n(-Chris)",
"Instead of a description, a possible diagnosis of my paralysis at the question 'what sort of music do you write?': I do want people to like me, a condition that extends to my music. I don’t want people to be put off from listening by what I say (which ignores the fact that invariably equivocating as I do does put people off, anyway...). The paralysis is that if I give the 'wrong' answer, then something is closed off (or I am hemmed in), whether or not that’s a fair and a reflection of reality.\n\n(-Chris)",
"If I could write a music that is simply sacred, secret, and beautiful, I’d be completely content.\n\n(-Chris)",  
"For this one, I defer to the Icelandic composer Anna Þorvaldsdóttir: 'As with my music generally, the inspiration… is not something I am trying to describe through the piece - to me, the qualities of the music are first and foremost musical. When I am inspired by a particular element or quality, it is because I perceive it as musically interesting, and the qualities I tend to be inspired by are often structural, like proportion and flow, as well as relationships of balance between details within a larger structure, and how to move in perspective between the two — the details and the unity of the whole.'\n\nThis so perfectly captures so many of my own feelings, that I don't know what else to add, beyond pointing out that there is *also* something deeply spiritual about the final, practial, obersvation about the balance between the details and 'unity of the whole'\n\n(-Chris)"
